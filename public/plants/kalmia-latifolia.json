There are 5 calyx lobes that are corolla campanulate. 5 lobes are pleated with 10 anthers that emerge at bloom (stamens included) but are at first tucked in small pockets."

Clinical effects typically occur within a few hours after ingestion, and can include acute digestive upset, excessive drooling, loss of appetite, frequent bowel movements/diarrhea, colic, sweating, abdominal pain, depression, weakness, loss of coordination, stupor, watering of eyes and nose, nausea, cardiac failure, vomiting, leg paralysis, weak heart rate, and recumbency for 2 or more days; at this point, improvement may be seen or the animal may become comatose and die.  Typically not very palatable to horses unless it is the only forage available, but sheep and goats may graze readily on the plant."
