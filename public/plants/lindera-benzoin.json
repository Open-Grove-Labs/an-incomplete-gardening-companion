    "This plant supports Palamedes Swallowtail (Papilio palamedes) larvae which has two flights from March-December with a partial 3rd flight in the South. The adult butterflies feed on nectar from flowers like sweet pepperbush, thistles, blue flag, and azalea. This plant also supports Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus) larvae which have 2 generations per year from April-October.  Adult Spicebush Swallowtail butterflies feed on nectar from Japanese honeysuckle, jewelweed, thistles, milkweed, azalea, dogbane, lantana, mimosa, and sweet pepperbush. Also a host plant for the Spicebush Swallowtail butterfly.  Fruits are eaten by songbirds, especially during fall migration.  White-tailed deer will browse twigs and leaves."

    "The Spice bush has clusters of tiny, apetalous, aromatic, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom along the branches in early spring before the foliage emerges (March-April). It has dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with the male flowers being larger and showier than the female ones. The flowers of female plants give way to bright red drupes. Female plants need a male pollinator in order to set fruit (scarlet red), however. It's drupes are very attractive, but are largely hidden by the foliage until the leaves drop."
