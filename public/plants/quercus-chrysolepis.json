  "uses": "Native Americans used acorns as food. The seeds were roasted and used as a form of coffee. The wood is heavy and hard. In the past, it was used for shipbuilding, furniture, fuel, and to make wagon axles and wheels for farm use. It was also used to make mauls or wedges for splitting wood. The wood from this tree may also be used for making paneling."
