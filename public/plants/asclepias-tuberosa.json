The plant is a larval host plant for monarch (which appear in the spring and summer and may have one to three broods in the north and four to six broods in the south), gray hairstreak, queen, and milkweed tussock moth caterpillars. This butterfly breeds all year long in Florida, south Texas, and southeastern California. Adult Monarch butterflies feed on nectar from all species of milkweeds."
