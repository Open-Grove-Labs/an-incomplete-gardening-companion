    "Three types of leaves. Leaves on strong shoots sessile, trifoliolate, the terminal leaflet longest, 23⁄4 to 31⁄4 in. long, very thick and rigid, glossy above, armed on each side with mostly five or six long spine-pointed teeth, apex narrowly acute, also terminated by a spine. Lateral leaflets much smaller.  The leaves of the second kind are borne in the axils of the first kind. They are thinner, shortly stalked, oblong-elliptic, 21⁄2 to 31⁄4 in. long, veiny and slightly glossy above, edged on each side with many fine, closely set, spiny teeth and are mostly simple. Leaves of intermediate form also, which are more coarsely toothed, spinier and glossier above than in the second type."
