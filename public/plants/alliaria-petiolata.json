    "The fruit is a four-sided elongated pod (1 1/2 to 2 inches long).  It starts out green and matures to gray-brown.  Inside are two rows of shiny black seeds which are released when the pod splits open mid-summer.   A single plant can produce hundreds of seeds, which scatter as much as several feet from the parent plant. This plant often forms colonies by reseeding itself."

However, as the flowers mature and develop seedpods, the raceme becomes more elongated and they become more separated."

When the leaves are crushed, they smell like garlic."
