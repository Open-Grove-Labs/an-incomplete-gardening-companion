    "This plant supports Harvester (Feniseca tarquinius) larvae which appear from February-September in the south. The Harvester butterfly does not sip flower nectar but they do feed on aphid honeydew. Harvester butterfly  and carnivorous larvae eat the aphids commonly found on alder.  White-tailed deer browse the foliage.  Birds and small mammals eat the pollen-rich male flower clusters in the spring."
