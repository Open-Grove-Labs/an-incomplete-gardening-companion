If left unmowed, blades will grow 4 to 10 inches long. At the base of each leaf blade is a collar with a membranous ligule about 1/4 inch long and no auricles or projections. At the base of the collar is the leaf sheath, which is slightly flattened. Frequently there is purplish coloration at the base of the grass stems."
