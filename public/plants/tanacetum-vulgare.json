  "uses": "The Pilgrims were the first to bring Common Tansy seeds to North America. The plant was to be used for medicinal purposes such as treating ulcers, constipation, hysteria, intestinal worms, rheumatism,  jaundice, and gastrointestinal problems.  From the 17th to 19th century, Europeans and Americans wrapped corpses in Common Tansy to prevent rapid decay. The leaves were used to repel flies, ants, and fleas around meats. The plant has also been researched as a possible insect repellant or insecticide for mosquitoes."
