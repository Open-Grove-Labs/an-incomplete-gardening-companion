    "This is a larval host plant for several butterflies.   Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) has three flights in the deep south from February-November and two flights in the north from May-September.  Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa) has one flight from June-July. Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax) has two broods from April-October. Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) has two to three broods from May-September. Eastern Comma (Polygonia comma) overwintered adults lay eggs in from early spring through April.  The summer adults appear and lay eggs for the winter form from May-September which appear as adults in September that find a place to overwinter and start the cycle over.   Eastern Comma rarely uses this host plant in North Carolina. Its buds and catkins are eaten by birds.  It provides excellent leaf season cover for birds in wetland sites. Salix genus support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Parandrena) andrenoides, Andrena (Thysandrena) bisalicis, Andrena (Tylandrena) erythrogaster, Andrena (Andrena) frigida, Andrena (Micrandrena) illinoiensis, Andrena (Andrena) macoupinensis, Andrena (Trachandrena) mariae, Andrena (Parandrena) nida, Andrena (Micrandrena) nigrae, Andrena (Micrandrena) salictaria, Andrena (Parandrena) wellesleyana."
