  "leaf-description": [
    "A rosette of ascending leaves about 2 to 4 feet tall. Each blade is elliptic-oblong in shape, its structure is pinnate-pinnatifid, and consists of 20 or more pairs of leaflets. The leaflets are longest toward the middle of each leaf (if they are sterile), becoming smaller toward both the top and the bottom. The pinnatifid leaflets are deeply lobed and narrowly lanceolate. There are 10 or more pairs of lobes per leaflet; that become gradually smaller toward the tip of each leaflet. The lobes are oblong and smooth along their margins; their tips are well-rounded. The upper surface of the leaves is medium green and glabrous, while the lower surface is pale green. The central stalk of each leaf is light green and terete. The petioles are mostly terete and lack scales. During the spring, rachis, petiole, and underside of fertile leaves are covered with white- or brown-woolly hairs. At this time, fertile leaves also have 2-7 pairs of leaflets toward the middle that are densely covered with spores and somewhat constricted or contorted in appearance. The tiny spores are released through narrow openings during the spring or summer. Infertile leaves leaflets have a normal appearance."
