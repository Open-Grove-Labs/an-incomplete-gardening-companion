    "The seeds from the flower heads are a winter food source for birds and small mammals.  Butterflies and bees are attracted to the many disc flowers. Flowers provide nectar to pollinators from July until the first frost. This is a larval host plant that supports Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis).  The Silvery Checkerspot has at least 1-2 broods in the north from June-July in the deep south and Texas, they have as many as 3-4 broods from May through September."
