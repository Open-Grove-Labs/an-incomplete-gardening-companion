  "uses": "The intensely fragrant foliage of this shrub is commonly harvested for a variety of purposes including cooking and potpourri.  Oil is commercially used in some perfumes, soaps, shampoos, lotions and other toiletries. Ancient Greeks and Romans threw sprigs of this plant into graves to signify their desire to remember the departed. This plant was also used in Ancient Greece to strengthen memory, and students wore sprigs in their hair when they studied."
