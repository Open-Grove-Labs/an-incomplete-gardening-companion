    "The copious amount of nectar in the showy flowers attracts butterflies including Monarch (Danaus plexippus) butterflies, skippers, and possibly moths. Other likely floral visitors include various long-tongued bees and wasps.  Redring milkweed is not an important food plant for Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars although which appear in the spring and summer and may have one to three broods in the north and four to six broods in the south. This butterfly breeds all year long in Florida, south Texas, and southeastern California. Adult Monarch butterflies feed on nectar from all species of milkweeds. The bitter white sap of the foliage contains toxic cardiac glycosides so it is avoided by mammalian herbivores. Very attractive to honey bees, native bees, and bumble bees."
