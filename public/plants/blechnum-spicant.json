    "This plant has a green, lance-shaped rosette that is pinnatifid, feels stiff and leathery, and arises in a vase-shaped clump. These fronds can be as long as 24 inches or as short as 8 inches. The fronds initially form a loose, flat rosette that is sterile. Later, fertile fronds 16 to 24 inches high emerge vertically from the rosette. They are similar to the sterile ones but taller, with much thinner and widely separated leaflets. Fertile fronds turn brown and wither by the end of the summer, leaving the evergreen sterile rosette."
