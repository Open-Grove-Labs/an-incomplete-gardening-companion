    "Long-lasting, yellowish-white flowers resemble tiny asters. Each mature plant terminates in a flat-headed panicle of flowerheads; each panicle is made up of several small corymbs of 2 to 5 flowerheads. Individual flowerheads are ¼ inch long and white to cream-colored; they are conical-oblongoid in shape. The sides of each flowerhead consist of many overlapping bracts that are white or cream-colored; these scale-like bracts are oblong-lanceolate to broadly oblong-lanceolate and they have blunt tips. At the apex of each flowerhead, there are many disk florets that are pale yellow to light brown; the innermost florets are perfect (both staminate and pistillate), while the remaining florets are pistillate. Each tiny floret is narrowly tubular. The blooming period occurs from late summer to early fall and lasts about a month."
