    "This plant supports Fritillary butterfly larvae. Nectar from the flowers attract butterflies and bees.  Members of the genus Viola support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Gonandrena) fragilis, Andrena (Gonandrena) integra, and Andrena (Gonandrena) platyparia. Butterflies and moths use this plant as a larval host. Birds and small mammals use the seed fruits as a food source.. This plant is resistant to damage by deer."
