    "The leaves of this genus can be more than five inches long. The arrangement depends on the subgenus- species in Streptocarpella carry their leaves singly or on opposite arrangement along a stem; species in Streptocarpus create a basal rosette. The latter is the most commonly found.\nThe leaves are green in color, linear to rounded with entire edges, wrinkles, hairs, and prominent veining."
