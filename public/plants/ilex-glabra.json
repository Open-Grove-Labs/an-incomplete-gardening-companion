    "This plant provides nectar for pollinators.  It is a larval host plant for Henry's Elfin (Callophrys henrici) larvae which appear from February to May and have one flight. Adult Henry's Elfin butterflies feed on flower nectar. Other adult butterflies and bees are attracted to the blossoms as well. Members of the genus Ilex support the following specialized bee:  Colletes banksi. The plant's fruits are eaten by many species of birds, including bobwhite quail and wild turkey and small mammals. Leaves are eaten by white-tailed deer and rabbits. This is also a cover plant for deer and other birds."
