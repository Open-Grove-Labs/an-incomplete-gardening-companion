    "Long narrow bloom spikes of rose pink shading to silver-white at the base.  Feathery spikes or plumes appear from early summer to mid-fall.  Flowers get larger over time so cut them when they are at the desired size but before they go to seed.  Remove most of the foliage and blooms can last up to 2 weeks cut.  Makes excellent dried arrangments."
