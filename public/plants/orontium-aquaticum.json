    "EDIBLE PARTS: Roots and seeds HARVEST TIME: Only collect roots and seeds from areas you know have NOT been treated with pesticides. Collect roots in spring. SAFE HANDLING PROCEDURES: Scrub roots and soak seeds thoroughly with warm water to remove dirt and debris. Do not use dish detergent or any type of sanitizer. These products can leave a residue. NEVER eat roots raw -- they can be very bitter. Boil for at least 30 minutes, changing the water several times during boiling. Serve with butter or lemon juice. Dry collected seeds in the same manner as you would dried peas or beans. Boil for at least 45 minutes, changing the water often. Serve like peas."
