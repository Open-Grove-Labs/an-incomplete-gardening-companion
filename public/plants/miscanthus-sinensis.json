    "Inflorescences a terminal panical of spikelets that unfurl atop the central vertical stalks, and differ among the numerous cultivars in terms of their time of emergence, color, separation from the upper foliage (well-separated or immersed within it), and Winter persistence. Secondary axes in elongate, finger-like racemes that grow up to 8\" long. Spikelets are paired, less than an inch in size, lanceolate, and with long silky hairs basally. As fruits develop, axes develop hairs that spread for seed dispersal."
