    "Flower bloom time depends on the plant location. When grown in tropical or sub-tropical conditions, blooms occur throughout the year, but especially in Spring and Summer. In warm southern climates, blooms usually occur in winter and spring. When grown as a houseplant, it will bloom from late winter well into fall. Green flowers are subtended by red or yellow showy paired bracts in cymes on long peduncles up to 2 inches. Several miniscule unisexual cyathia, enclosed in a 5-lobed involucre, bear glands and are subtended by a showy pair of bracts. The bracts are ovate, red, salmon or yellow, and about 1/3 of an inch."
