The spadix is erect, cylindric, often tapering, sometimes twisted.  The spathe is persistent and at a right angle to spadix, an identifying feature for this genus.  It is usually flat, sometimes hooded, erect, spreading, or reflexed, with margins not overlapping at the base, and deeply veined.  The scape is long and taller than the foliage."
