    "Members of the genus Acer support Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. The seeds are eaten by birds and small mammals. The cavities are utilized by cavity-nesting birds.  Deer and moose browse the stems and leaves. Porcupines consume the bark and can girdle the upper stem. Butterflies and other pollinating insects enjoy the nectar from the flowers."
