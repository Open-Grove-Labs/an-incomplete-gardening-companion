    "The leaves contain oxalic acid that, taken in large amounts, can bind up the body's supply of calcium leading to nutritional deficiency.  People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution since it can aggravate their condition. All parts of the plant have toxic potential, although the possibility of serious effects is usually limited to ingestion of large quantities and there have been no documented cases in humans. Consuming Oxalis species can produce colic in horses, and kidney failure is possible if significant amounts are eaten.\nCaution: large quantities may cause trembling, cramps, and staggering as in grazing animal"

Use sparingly, because all parts of the plant have a low amount of toxicity (oxalic acid) if ingested. The quantity of oxalic acid will be reduced if the leaves are cooked."
