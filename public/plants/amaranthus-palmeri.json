Leaves have fairly long petioles and are arranged symmetrically around the stem, giving the plant a distinctly poinsettia-like appearance when viewed from above. Petioles are longer than with common pigweed.  Leaf-blades are elliptical to diamond-shaped with pointed tips, and measure 0.6–3 inches long by 0.4–1.5 inches wide.  Some leaves may have a white watermark shaped like a 'V'."
