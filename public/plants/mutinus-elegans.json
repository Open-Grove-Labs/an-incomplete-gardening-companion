  "fruit-description": [
    "The 'fruit' of any fungus is a solid structure that creates and disperses spores, which are the means of reproduction. With the mushrooms we cook, the form is a stem and a cap. Under the cap are thin 'membranes' that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The spores are carried on the sides of the membranes.\n \tIn the case of a stinkhorn, the form is a hollow column with a hole at the top. As the spores mature they are exuded through this hole as a stinking, greenish mass.\n\tThe horn of the Elegant Stinkhorn varies from pink to orange in color. It is about 4 inches long and between 0.5 and 0.75 inches in diameter. They develop very quickly."
