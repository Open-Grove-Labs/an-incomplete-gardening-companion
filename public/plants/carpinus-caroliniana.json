    "It is a larval host plant for the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail and Red-spotted Purple butterflies. The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilo glaucus) has three flights from February-November in the deep south and March-September in the north.    The Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax) has two broods from April-October. The seed and buds provide food source for songbirds, ruffed grouse, quail, wild turkeys, foxes, and squirrels.  On young specimens, the inner bark is eaten by beavers and rabbits.  These plants also provide good cover and shelter for animals."
