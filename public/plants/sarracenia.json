    "After the petals drop and if the ovary has been pollinated, it will begin to swell. The seed pod develops at the top of the flower. It takes 5 months for the seed pod to mature. It turns brown and then splits open to scatter the seeds. The dry capsule contains pear-shaped seeds anywhere from 20 to 300 seeds. The seeds are scattered and germinate after a period of cold weather."

They bloom in early spring before the first pitcher is formed. The stalks are taller than the pitchers so the pollinators can reach their blooms without getting trapped. There colors vary from red, purple, pink, yellow, white, copper, or multicolored."

  "leaf-description": [
    "The carnivorous leaf is a narrow hollow cone known as a pitcher. The pitcher has a hood or lid that prevents the insect from escaping.  At the lid attachment, there is the throat or neck which has nectar bait inside. The neck secretes the nectar which attracts the insect. The insect slips and falls into the pitcher. It is digested by the pitcher as food. The pitcher color varies from red, purple, white, green, yellow, copper, or multi-colored depending on the species. Some species also have non-carnivorous leaves."
