    "Submerged portions provide habitats for many micro and macroinvertebrates. These invertebrates, in turn, are used as food by fish and other wildlife species (e.g. amphibians, reptiles, ducks, etc.). After aquatic plants die, their decomposition by bacteria and fungi provides food (called “detritus”) for many aquatic invertebrates. Attracts moths at night with increased fragrance."
