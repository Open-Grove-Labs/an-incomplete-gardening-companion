    "This plant provides nectar for pollinators including Monarch (Danaus plexippus) butterflies. It is the larval host plant for Monarch (Danaus plexippus) larvae which appear in the spring and summer and may have one to three broods in the north and four to six broods in the south. This butterfly breeds all year long in Florida, south Texas, and southeastern California. Adult Monarch butterflies feed on nectar from all species of milkweeds. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators. Deer tolerant."
