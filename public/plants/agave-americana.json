    "When it blooms, it sends up a single flowering stalk from the center of the leaves reaching 15-30' tall or more. The flowering stalk resembles a narrow telephone pole with horizontal branching near the top. Greenish-yellow flowers (each to 3-4\" long) bloom in panicles at the branch ends. As the plant is flowering, vegetative offsets appear at the base of the dying mother plant so this plant is easily propagated.  Its striking sculptural form makes it a great specimen or accent plant for winter interest in a garden."
