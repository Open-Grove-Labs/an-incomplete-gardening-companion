    "The twice-pinnately compound leaves are vinelike fronds that can grow 90 feet long. Leaflets are usually triangular in shape, 3-6 in. long, 2-3 in. wide and finely dissected with hairs on the undersurface. They are pinnately compound to decompound and dimorphic. Pinnae are borne on rachis in distant pairs on short stalks. The sterile pinnae is entire to serrate, with an elongated terminal pinnul. Lateral pinnules are 2-3 per side and are unequal. The smaller pinnaes are fertile, with pinnules developing finger-like lobes. Stipes and rachis are wiry and twinging."
