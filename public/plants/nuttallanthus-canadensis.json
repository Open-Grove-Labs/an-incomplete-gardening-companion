  "wildlife-value": [
    "This plant supports Common Buckeye (Junonia coenia) larvae. Common Buckeye's flights generally occur between May through October with 2-3 broods. However, in the Deep South, the flights can occur throughout the whole year. Caterpillars eat the host plant's leaves while adults feed on the nectar of composite flowers including aster, chicory, gumweed, knapweed, and tickseed sunflower. Nectar source to bees and butterflies."
