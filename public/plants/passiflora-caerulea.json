    "The fruit, while edible, tastes bland. The plant produces egg-shaped green fruits which when ripened, turn yellow to a deep orange color from late summer to fall.  The fruits measure approximately 2.5 x 1.5 inches and are partly hollow.  Inside the fruit, there is a small amount of deep red colored pulp surrounded by a large number of seeds.  To gather seeds, allow the pods to dry on the plant.  Break open pods to collect the seeds. The seeds are 4mm long and silvery brown in color.  Sow seeds outdoors in the fall. During the winter, sow seeds in a cold frame or unheated greenhouses."

The filament is blue on the outer half, white in the middle, and dark purple-black at the base.  In the center are the 3 styles which are purple, and the 5 stamens are greenish-yellow.
