    "They make a quality food source for bobwhite, turkey, grouse, and deer. This is a larval host plant for many species of butterfly.  Silver-Spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus) appears from May-September with three-four broods in the deep south, two broods in the east, and one brood in the north and west.  Hoary Edge (Achalarus lyciades) has two broods from April-September in most of its range, one brood from June-August in the north.  Northern Cloudywing (Thorybes pylades) broods from May-July in the north, earlier in the south and two broods from March-September in Texas.  Southern Cloudywing (Thorybes bathyllus) which has two broods (possibly three) from June-early October in most of its range, one brood mid-June-mid-July in the north. Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) has three to four flights from February-November in the south and two flights from May-September in the north.  Eastern Tailed-Blue (Everes comyntas) has many broods from February-November. In the winter, its seeds serve as a food source for songbirds, quail, and small mammals."
