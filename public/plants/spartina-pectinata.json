    "Glossy dark green leaves to 4 feet long and 5/8 of an inch wide have sharp edges. Leaves turn yellow in autumn. The alternate leaves are located primarily along the lower half of the stem. The leaf blades are linear, flat, and glabrous (smooth). The leaf blades have a rather thick succulent texture, fine parallel veins, and prominent midribs; they are typically arching (curving upward from their bases next to the culm and then curving downward toward their tips). The leaf sheaths are green, yellowish green, or light brown; they are glabrous with fine longitudinal veins. Each ligule at the junction of the blade and sheath consists of a ring of dense white hairs."
