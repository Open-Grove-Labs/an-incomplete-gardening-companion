    "Male and female flowers are usually on separate plants. For both sexes, flowers are in large open to dense branching clusters (panicles). The branches of the panicle are usually purple and glabrous. Flowers of both sexes are petal-less and about 1/3 inch across, with 4 to 6 greenish-white sepals that may drop off early. The female flowers have about 10 thread-like white pistils that resemble petals.  Male flowers have about 12 dangling white to greenish stamens with pale yellow tips that turn brown with age."
