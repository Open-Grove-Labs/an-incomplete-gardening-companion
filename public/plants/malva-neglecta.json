    "Flowers appear as showy papery white, to light pink to light purple, 5-petaled blooms.  The petals are notched at the tip so a blossom may appear to have 10 petals. A short flowering stalk (peduncle) about 1 inch long will produce 1 to 3 flowers, each about ¾ of an inch across with 5 slightly notched petals. In the absence of a major disturbance, the blooming period usually occurs during the summer and lasts about 2-3 months. However, some plants will bloom during late spring or early fall."
