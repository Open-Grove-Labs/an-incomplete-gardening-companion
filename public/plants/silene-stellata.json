    "The showy flowers appear as terminal clusters of white tubular blooms atop the tall stems. The panicle of flowers measures up to 8 inches long and 3 to 4 inches wide. The flowers may occur singularly or in groups of 2 to 3 at the tip of the stem and have short pedicels. The blooms are deeply fringed with five white petals and a light green bell-shaped calyx.  Each bloom measures 3/4 to 1-inch wide. The calyx and stalk have dense short hairs. Ten thread-like white stamens protrude past the petal tips. The flowers may close slightly in the bright sunlight or the middle of the day. They bloom from June to August for about 3 to 4 weeks. They have no floral scent."
