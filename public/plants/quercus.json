    "Oak trees support a wide variety of Lepidopteran.  You may see Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. Banded Hairstreak (Satyrium calanus), which have one flight from June-August everywhere but Florida where they emerge April-May. Edward's Hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii), has one flight from May-July in the south and June-July in the north.  Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), has three to four flights in the south from February-November and two flights in the north from May-September.  White-M Hairstreak (Parrhasius m-album) has three broods in the north from February-October.  Horace’s Duskywing (Erynnis horatius) has three broods in Texas and the deep south from January-November, and two broods in the north from April-September.  Juvenal’s Duskywing (Erynnis juvenalis) has one brood from April-June, appearing as early as January in Florida. Acorns provide food to birds and mammals. The tree provides shelter to birds and mammals. They are host plants to moths and butterflies."
