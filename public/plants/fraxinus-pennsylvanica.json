There are usually a large number of samara, and they appear narrow, 1 to 2 inches long, and 1/4 inch wide. Their color changes from green to tan as they mature. They hang in dangling clusters and are displayed on the tree from August to October. They can persist on the tree through the winter."

The leaves are dark green and smooth on the upper surface, and the undersides are pale green with a silky pubescence. The margins may be crenate to serrate or entire.  The pair of leaflets at the base of the leaf is smaller. The foliage turns yellow to bronze in fall, with the quality of the fall color often varying considerably from year to year."
