    "The fruit is a cylinder-shaped seed capsule.  When the capsule dries, it releases 2 or 3 seeds.  The seeds measure 1/8 inch in size and appear papery and disc-shaped.  They may self-seed and naturalize under ideal conditions.  Germination requires about 1 to 3 months.  They should be planted at the end of the fall or before the last frost in the spring."
