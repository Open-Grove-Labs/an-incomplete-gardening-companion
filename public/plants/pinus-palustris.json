    "This plant supports Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. The Longleaf pine provides winter cover.  Fox and gray squirrels, quail, brown-headed nuthatches, mourning doves, and turkeys eat the seeds.  Red-cockaded woodpeckers excavate cavities in the living specimens of this species."
