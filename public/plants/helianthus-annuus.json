    "It is a great late-nectar plant for butterflies including monarch's and other pollinators.  This is a larval host plant that supports Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis).  The Silvery Checkerspot has at least 1-2 broods in the north from June-July in the deep south and Texas, they have as many as 3-4 broods from May through September. Birds are attracted to seeds so leave standing dead flowers into the winter as natural bird feeders.  Members of the genus Helianthus support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) accepta, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) aliciae, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) helianthi, Melissodes (Eumelissodes) agilis, Dieunomia (Dieunomia) heteropoda, Megachile (Sayapis) pugnata, and Paranthidium (Paranthidium) jugatorium."
