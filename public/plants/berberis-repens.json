The leaves are compond pinnate, meaning that a stem holds several, 3-7, leaflets on each side which makes up one compound leaf. Leaves feel dull and leathery, again like hollies. There are multiple spiny teeth on the sides of the leaflets. Leaf color is bluish-green in summer and a purplish shade in winter."
