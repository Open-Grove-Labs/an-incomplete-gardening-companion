    "Leathery, lance-shaped, evergreen (green at Christmas time as the common name suggests) fronds. Stocking shape of the pinnae also suggests Christmas. Crosiers (young fiddleheads) in spring are silvery and scaled. Sori appear on the undersides of the pinnae only at the ends (last 1/3) of the fronds.\nThe Christmas fern has tufted circular clump of stiff, deep green fronds (leaves). The blade is a once-pinnately compound, linear-lanceolate shaped broadest at the base. Its fertile fronds are taller, more rigid, more erect, constricted at the tip and die in the winter. Its sterile fronds are smaller and less erect and remain evergreen. Sterile pinnae are in the middle and base of fronds, are linear-oblong, are basally acutely auriculate, and are minutely spinose-dentate. The pinnae are auricled with marginal bristle teeth and are dimorphic with 20-35 pinnae pairs. The stipe and rachis are scaly and chaffy. Its short stipe is green but brown at base. Its yellow spored sori occur only on terminal one-third of the frond. Its fronds have many leaflets and grow directly from the ground in a clump, so no bark is present. This fern produces black spores on the underside of the leaf."
