    "Most of the thorn-less cultivars do not have fruits. Occasionally, some will display a large number of fruit. The fruit is a bean-like pod,  7 to 8 inches long, and 1 inch wide. They are yellowish-green to reddish-brown to purplish at maturity, and the margin of the pod contracts causing coiling. The pod contains shiny, hard, dark brown, oval-shaped seeds.  In the fall the pods split open releasing the seeds. The falling fruits can be messy."
