The others are linear needles that appear thick, long, flat, fleshy, and measure 3 to 5 inches in length and about 0.25 inches wide. They are glossy, dark green on the upper surface, and they have two white bands on the lower surface. The leaves are crowded at the tips. Each node has a group of needles that are whorled or in the shape of an umbrella. Each whorl consists of 20 to 30 needles that radiate around the stem."
