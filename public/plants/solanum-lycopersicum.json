    "The fruits or berries of the tomato are edible. They may be eaten raw, cooked, dried, or processed. They are a rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, folic acid, and antioxidants.  Lycopene is an antioxidant that gives the tomato its rich red color. Many plants will drop fruit when ripe or the fruit will come off easily.  Tomatoes will continue to ripen once picked.  Store them at room temperature."

Additional Toxicology:  According to Dr. Anna Dulaney, Clinical Toxicologist and Assistant Director of Education for the Carolinas Poison Center, since their database began in 1997 there has been only one reference to a child having a reaction related to consuming tomato leaves or stems.  In that instance, the child made and consumed a \"Pie\" consisting of cedar wood chips, grass clippings, tomato leaves, and various other items.  That child vomited, but due to a large number of ingredients in the mixture, it is impossible to attribute the upset stomach to the consumption of tomato leaves.  She noted that in their database, the largest number of tomato leaves consumed at one time was 5 or 6 and that there were no ill effects.

  "uses": "The tomato was cultivated by the Inca Indians in 700 A.D. They were introduced to Europe in the 16th century. In the 1500s, many rich people thought the tomato was poisonous. They ate their food on pewter plates. The high acid content in the tomatoes caused the lead from the plates to leech into their food which caused lead poisoning and death.  Poor people had wooden plates and suffered no ill effects; therefore, tomatoes were only eaten by the poor until the 1800s. The earliest recipe for ketchup appeared in 1818 and was developed by housewives in Maine. In the late 1800s, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the tomato was to be legally considered a vegetable instead of fruit.  In the early 1900s, the nutritive value of tomatoes was recognized."
