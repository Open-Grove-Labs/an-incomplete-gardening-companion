When it is slightly soft, it is ready to eat.  If too soft, it's overripe and not edible.  The fruit is produced on female vines."

The veins of this leaf can be easily seen, especially underneath the leaf where the mid-vein is sticking out a little bit.  The lower surface is covered with white, star-shaped hairs.  The veins are whitish-green and also covered with star-shaped hairs."
