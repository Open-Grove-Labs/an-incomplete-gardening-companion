    "Male and female cone buds form in the late summer. They are pollinated from mid-April to mid-May. Fertilization occurs in August and by that time the cones are full-size. The cones are oval, woody, green to reddish-brown, and about 2 inches long and 1-inch wide.  Seed cones mature and open in 2 years.  They are persistent for up to 20 years. The cones have 30 to 50 spirally arranged scales. There are several seeds inside each scale. The seeds are dark brown and about 0.2 inches long with a yellowish-brown wing on each side. Some seeds are released as the cone shrinks in hot weather. Most of the seeds are released when the cones dry or are damaged by insects."
