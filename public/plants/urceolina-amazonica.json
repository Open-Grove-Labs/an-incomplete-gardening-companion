  "bulb-storage": [
    "Store bulbs in peat at 68 degrees F (20 degrees C). To induce flowering, the growing plants must receive at least four weeks at 80-85 degrees (27-29 degrees C) followed by a minimum temperature drop of 14 degrees F (8 degrees C), e.g., down to 65-70 degrees F (18-21 degrees C). These temperatures must be very constant or bulbs may not flower. After 12 weeks at the lower temperatures, the plants should flower. Subsequently, the high temperature treatment should be repeated. Thus, the plants can flower twice per year. If water is withheld, the foliage will senesce and sometimes this will also induce flowering."

    "Normally blooms in winter but can be a seasonal bloomer 2-3 times a year by cutting back on water for one month.  When new growth appears, resume watering.  Flowers appear in clusters of 3-6 flowers that are daffodil-like, showy, fragrant, waxy white blooms.  They are grown commercially for cut flowers."
