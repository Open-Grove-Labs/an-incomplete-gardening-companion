    "The flowers are subsequently followed by round, bright red  berries that typically ripen in late summer (June-July) . A pair of flowers yields one berry, hence the additional common name of twinberry for this plant. The berries, which have a tiny dimple and star-shaped marks, are edible but rather tasteless. The berries often persist on the plants throughout winter. They are 1/4\" long and 3/8\" across."
