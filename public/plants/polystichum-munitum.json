  "uses": "The sword fern was a food source for Native Americans. They ate the rhizomes by boiling, baking, or steaming.  The fern was also used to treat skin sores, chewed for treating sore throats, make a poultice for burns, and treat dandruff.  The fronds were also used to make mats for cleaning and drying fish or tied to make a mattress. It is now widely cultivated and used by florists in making floral arrangements"
