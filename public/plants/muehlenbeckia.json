    "The flowers on these plants range from nearly invisible to eye catching. They appear at the ends of the stems singly, in ones and twos and sometimes in a raceme. Individually they are small and simple in shape. It is when they appear in a raceme or a cluster that you notice them. The color ranges from white, through yellow to green and every combination of those three colors that you can imagine. Some species are dioecious, like holly, so you would have to plant both sexes to get fruit."
