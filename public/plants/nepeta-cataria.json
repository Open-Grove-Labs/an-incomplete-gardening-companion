    "Cats love it. The nectar of the flowers attracts long-tongued bees primarily, including honey bees, bumblebees, cuckoo bees (Epeolus spp., Triepeolus spp.), long-horned bees (Melissodes spp.), and leaf-cutting bees (Megachile spp.). Other visitors that occasionally visit the flowers include Halictid bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, and skippers. The foliage is one of the food sources for the caterpillars of such moths as Sphinx eremitus (Hermit Sphinx) and the polyphagous Xanthotype urticaria (False Crocus Geometer)."
