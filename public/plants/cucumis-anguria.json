    "The \"vegetable\" is botanically a fruit– it is a pepo, a berry with a hard rind.  Long and cylindrical, starting out prickly when young and smoothing out to a bumpy surface as it matures.  Length and girth can vary based on cultivar and culinary purpose but grow at least 3 inches long.  Some varieties are bred to be seedless. The surface of the fruit is covered in hairs, spines or warts."
