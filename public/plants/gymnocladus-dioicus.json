The seeds are hard, smooth, oval, somewhat flat, and measure about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inches wide.  Male trees are considered desirable because of the lack of pods."

Each flower measures 1/2 to 5/8 inches in diameter. The female flowers give way to reddish-brown seed pods in the fall."

The margins are entire, the upper surface is smooth with scattered hairs, and the lower surface is paler and hairy along the veins. The leaves emerge in late spring and are pinkish-bronze initially, turn bluish-green during the summer months, and the fall color is yellow. The leaves appear late in the spring and drop from the tree early in the fall."
