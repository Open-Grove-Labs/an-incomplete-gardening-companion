    "Trees are mostly dioecious, having male and female cones on separate trees, however, both male and female cones occasionally appear on the same tree.  Oblong male cones up, to 6 inches in length, are situated in clusters at the ends of shoots and release pollen to female seed cones via wind dispersion.  Pineapple-shaped female seed cones are ovoid to spherical, up to 8 inches in size and contain up to 200 seeds.  At maturity, which takes 2-3 years, seed cones drop to the ground where they release the seeds.  Mature trees release a prolific amount of seeds but cannot do so until they are 30-40 years old."

    "Thick, simple, alternate, ovate-lanceolate leaves are triangularly shaped, scale-like, and densely arranged spirally around the stem such that the stem is not visible.  On younger trees, the leaves also cover the bark.  The base of each leaf is the widest, then tapering to a stiff, spiny pointed tip.  Leaf dimensions are relatively broad (about 1 inch wide at the base and up to 2 inches in length to its pointed tip).  Leaves are very hard and sharp and may last for up to 10-15 years."

  "uses": "Indigenous peoples of Chile and Argentina harvest the seeds for food, using them to make flour and a fermented beverage (muday).  Some consider the tree to be sacred.  Its long straight trunk was historically desirable for lumber, but logging is currently prohibited due to its endangered status."
