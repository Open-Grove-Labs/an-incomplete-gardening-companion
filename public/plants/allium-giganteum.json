    "Leaves, bulbs, and bulblets are edible. Gather leaves during spring and fall. Gather bulbs in the second year when they are large enough to use like cultivated onions. Flower stem bulblets are collected during the summer. However, the plant also has poisonous characteristics as noted in the \"Poisonous to Humans\" section of this record. Toxicity can depend on the age of the person or animal, the age of the plant, the part of the plant ingested, how much is ingested, whether the person or animal has sensitivities or allergies, whether it's eaten raw or cooked, and so forth.  Consult with a medical professional for further details."
