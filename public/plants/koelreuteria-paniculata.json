The fruits are present from August to October."

Leaflets near the base are deeply lobed, giving the leaf the appearance of being bipinnately compound. Leaves are vivid green above, and the veins underneath can be pubescent. New leaves are pinkish bronze to purple and turn green as they mature. The fall color is variable but golden yellow."
