  "uses": "The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked. They have a slightly bitter flavour and are mostly added to salads as the leaves can also be used as a lettuce substitute. Native Americans ate the young stems and leaves of smaller, non-woody varieties. The root was used as an astringent and the crushed plant as a poultice for rope burns and minor wounds."
