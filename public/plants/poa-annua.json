    "P. annua is a cosmopolitan grass that is listed as one of the most aggressive weeds invading areas from sea level up to 1200 m in elevation. It can be found from the Arctic to the Antarctic regions in practically all terrestrial ecosystems. It is listed as a weed in 38 crops in more than 80 countries within and outside its native distribution range. It grows in a wide variety of soils",

    "mowing",
    "and frozen conditions",
    "and is a frequent weed in areas heavily trafficked by livestock or humans. This species has the potential to outcompete other plants and crops. The list of countries in which this species now occurs may not be complete",
    "as P. annua has spread to almost all areas of the world where temperate and subtropical crops are grown",
    "and to some relatively undisturbed habitats."
