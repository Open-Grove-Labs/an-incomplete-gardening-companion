    "Cardamom seeds are a popular spice used in flavoring spicy and rustic dishes, such as long simmering soups and stews, lentils, rice, pasta, curries, and meat dishes. Its mild, smoky, roasted flavor comes from the seed pods being dried over open flames, enhancing the other ingredients in the dish.  Leaves of the plant can also be cooked and consumed as greens, the roots can be boiled and eaten like potatoes, the flowers can be used as a garnish and the pods are used in beef and chicken curries."
