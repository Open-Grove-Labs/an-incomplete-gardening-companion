    "Blooms from May to October. In spring, each stem terminates in a pyramid-shaped panicle of spikelets about 2½-6\" long; this panicle has a central axis with spreading, whorled, lateral branches. The branches terminate in solitary spikelets. All these structures are light green, slender, and slightly wiry. Individual spikelets are small, ovoid or broadly ellipsoid in shape, hairless to sparsely pubescent, and light green to greenish purple. In fall, panicles of spikelets are produced that remain inserted within their sheaths (and thus, hidden from view). These panicles are smaller and self-pollinating."
