    "The leaves of this plant are what make it. They are thick and fleshy and come in a range of colors, shapes, sizes and markings. The color is better in full sun. They wither and drop off from the bottom and can be a source of disease if not removed.  They have a point at the tip, but can be distinguished from Aonium by the entire margins and more upright habit.  Most are smooth and hairless and some have a glaucous bloom on the surface."
