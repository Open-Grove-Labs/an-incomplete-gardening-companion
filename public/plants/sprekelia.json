Each flower is bilaterally symmetrical with six long tepals, with the broader, central upper one upright, two narrow lateral ones that are curved back at the tips and three lower narrow deflexed ones partly fused together, rolling up in a horizontal cylinder, encircling the long filaments of the stamens and large anthers with yellow pollen."

    "The long, dark-green, strap-like leaves emerge in spring about the same time as or before the flowers. In their native habitat this is typically just after the first rains. Several leaves are produced from each bulb, growing in an upright rosette at first, then flopping over as they get longer."
