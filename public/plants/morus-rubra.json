    "The Red mulberry has heart-shaped, thin, toothed, usually dark green leaves (3 to 5 inches long, 2 to 4 inches wide). The leaves can be quite variable, however, ranging from unlobed to deeply lobed and from rough-textured to glabrous on the upper surfaces. Lobed leaves are more frequently found on new shoots and unlobed leaves are more frequently found in tree crowns. The leaves turn yellow in fall. Underside of leaf has fine hairs and is soft to the touch. The leaves can be lobed or un-lobed with a very rough top side and hairy underside, typically do not have more than 4 lobes."
