    "This tree provides some food and significant cover for wildlife. Its flowers attract bees. It is the only native larval host plant for viceroy (Limenitis archippus) butterflies. This is a larval host plant for several butterflies.   Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) has three flights in the deep south from February-November and two flights in the north from May-September.  Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa) has one flight from June-July.   Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax) has two broods from April-October. Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) has two to three broods from May-September. Eastern Comma (Polygonia comma) overwintered adults lay eggs in from early spring through April.  The summer adults appear and lay eggs for the winter form from May-September which appear as adults in September that find a place to overwinter and start the cycle over. Eastern Comma rarely uses this host plant in North Carolina. It is also larval host for (Automeris io) moths."
