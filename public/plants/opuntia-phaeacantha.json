  "leaf-description": [
    "What appear to be leaves are actually modified stem segments. These pads are flattened and obovate to circular. They function as a moisture reservoir that can be accessed during drought. When full, they are thick and greenish grey. However, during a period of drought they slowly shrink, become wrinkled and turn a dull grey/brown color. The next rain will quickly repair the damage. \n\tBecause they could be a source of moisture for any wandering animal the plant has devised a means to protect this valuable resource – spines and bristles. The spines can be over three inches long, straight or curved. They are carried in groups of two to eight all across the pad. The bristles are the really nasty ones. They are only 0.2 of an inch long – virtually invisible. They are barbed and can easily puncture the skin and cause an irritation. Always wear leather gloves when working with or near any cactus."

  "uses": "Native Peoples use just about every part of this plant in one way or another. The fruit is eaten fresh, dried, cooked, as jellies, jams and candies, as juice or wine.\n\tThe spines are used to create tattoo designs, as needles, to make holes for earrings, to get out splinters.\n\tThe pads are roasted, boiled, fried, pulped and made into cakes, and dried. Strips of pads are peeled, parboiled, then boiled to make chewing gum. Sometimes the strips are boiled in sugar water, dried and eaten as candy. Or they can be boiled in the sugar water until they have dissolved and formed a syrup which is eaten as jelly. \n\tAmong some peoples, the pads are heated and applied to the breasts to encourage the flow of milk."
