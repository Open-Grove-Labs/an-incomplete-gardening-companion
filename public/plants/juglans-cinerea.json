  "uses": "The wood is used to make furniture, cabinetry, instrument cases, interior woodwork, hand-carved wall panels, trim, church decoration, and altars. The nut is popularly used in New England for making maple-butternut candy.  Early settlers used fruit husks and inner bark to make orange or yellow dye and root bark for a laxative. The outer bark was used to make teas to treat dysentery and toothaches. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. They also used nuts to make oil for anointing."
