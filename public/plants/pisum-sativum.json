  "edibility": [
    "Seeds, pods, flowers, and shoots can all be eaten raw, stir-fried, or cooked. Pods and seeds vary in size and edibility with variety as well as harvesting times; they are roughly divided into shelling peas (garden peas) that are harvested when the seeds are almost or completely mature and edible pod peas (snow peas and sugar snap peas) that are harvested when the pods and seeds are young and not fully mature.  Garden peas are best used immediately after picking as their sweetness quickly degrades or left to dry for long-term storage. Edible-pod varieties can last in the fridge for a couple of weeks. Harvest every few days.  The flowers and young shoot tips (top 6 in) can also be harvested and eaten."
