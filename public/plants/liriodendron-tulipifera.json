The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilo glaucus) has three flights from February-November in the deep south and March-September in the north. The Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus) has two broods from April-October, and Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) has two to three broods from May-September and all year in Florida. Hummingbirds, butterflies, bees, and birds like cedar waxwings feed on the nectar from flowers. White-tailed deer, gray squirrels, and some songbirds eat the flowers in the spring. Sprouts, buds, and seeds are primary food for deer and squirrels."

Flowers have numerous stamens and pistils are fused. Flowers have 3 reflexed sepals. Although the flowers are 1.5 to 2 inches in length, they can go unnoticed on large trees because the flowers appear high in the crown of the tree and after the leaves are fully developed. Sometimes the flowers are first noticed when the attractive petals begin to fall below the tree. Flowers bloom from May to early June."

Some leaves will turn yellow and drop during drought. The bright green leaves (3 to 8 inches across and wide) with paler undersides turn golden yellow in fall."

Wood from this tree is somewhat weak and is used for furniture, plywood, boats, veneer, paper pulp, and general lumber. It is light, soft, and easily worked. The wood has also been used to make musical instruments and toys. Native Americans used this tree to make dugout canoes. They also used the inner bark of this tree as a medicine for cough and cholera."
