    "This plant supports provides nectar for pollinators and is a larval host plant for several butterflies.  The Gulf Fritillary (Agraulis vanillae) appear from January-November in the north and throughout the year in southern Florida and Texas.  Variegated Fritillary (Euptoieta claudia) has four broods from February-December in the souther and three broods from April-October in the north. Zebra Heliconian (Heliconius charithonia) appears all year in Florida and Texas and appears in other northern states during warm months. Hummingbirds and butterflies nectar from the flowers in the summer. Its fruit may be eaten by songbirds, small mammals and some larger mammals."
