    "Narrow, green, heavily veined, upright pitchers.  Top of the pitcher is marbled reddish brown.  Summer-produced pitchers are more robust than those produced in spring. Modified leaves form distinctive, upright, slender-fluted pitchers 12 to 18 inches tall. Each pitcher has a horizontal lid that arches over the tube opening to prevent rain from entering the tube. Tube opening (mouth) is about 1 inch wide. This species infrequently produces slender, linear, winter leaves in warm winter locations."
