    "This plant supports Clouded Sulphur (Colias philodice) larvae which appear from May to October in the North and from March to November in the South. There are 3 flights in the North and 4 to 5 flights in the South. Adult Clouded Sulfur butterflies feed on flower nectar from many different plants. This plant also supports Eastern Tailed-Blue (Everes comyntas) which has many broods from February-November, Orange Sulphur (Colias eurytheme), Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), and Northern Cloudywing (Thorybes pylades) larvae which broods a little earlier than May-July."
