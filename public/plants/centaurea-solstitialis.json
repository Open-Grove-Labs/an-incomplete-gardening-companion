    "Leaves are alternate and form a basal rosette up to 6 inches long when young, often lobed in narrow sections on the lower half of the leaf, and tapering to a short stalk.  This rosette will wither by the time the plant flowers.  All leaves are toothless and covered in woolly hairs giving a gray-green cast.  Leaves become much smaller, linear-oblong and undivided as they move further up the stem with the leaf bases extending down the stem, forming “wings”. The wings are often wavy and may be broad with jagged or smooth edges."
