    "The nectar and pollen of the Sand blackberry flowers attract many kinds of insects, butterflies, and especially long-tongued and short-tongued bees. It provides protective cover year-round for numerous small animals and birds. The fruits are relished by songbirds, small mammals, foxes, raccoons and black bears. During the winter, birds and small mammals eat the seeds left from rotten fruit. White-tailed deer and rabbits browse the leaves."
