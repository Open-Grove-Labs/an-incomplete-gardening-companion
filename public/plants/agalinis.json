    "Members of the genus Agalinus support butterfly larvae and adults.  Common Buckeye (Junonia coenia) larvae appear from May to October and in the deep south they appear year-round. Common Buckeye adult butterflies feed on flower nectar. Members of the genus Agalinis support the following specialized bee: Anthophorula (Anthophorisca) micheneri, Leaf-cutting bees (Megachile spp.). Syrphid flies feed on pollen."
