    "This plant provides nectar for pollinators.  It is a larval host plant for Henry's Elfin (Callophrys henrici) larvae which appear from February to May and have one flight. Adult Henry's Elfin butterflies feed on flower nectar. Its fruits are eaten by songbirds, wild turkeys, quail, white-tailed deer, squirrels and other small mammals.  Honeybees are attracted to its tiny white flowers. This tree provides cover during the winter."
