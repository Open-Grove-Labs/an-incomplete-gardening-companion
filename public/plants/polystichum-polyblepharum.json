    "Lance-shaped, shiny, bipinnate, dark green fronds (to 1-2’ long) come out from a central crown.  They are finely divided with golden hairs and have overlapping pinnae.  As fronds unfurl, crosiers flip over backward to form lax tassels, hence the common name.  Tassles disappear as fronds mature and flatten.   Bristly scales are found on the stipe and rachis."
