    "The flowers are tubular and held on upright clusters, with as many as 20 flowers per cluster.  The flowers are held to one side of the flower stalk, giving the appearance of flags blowing in the wind.  The flowers are orange-red as they open, but they fade to yellow and then white as they age.  All colors will be present within a cluster at the same time. Blossoms will appear from mid-Summer to first frost as single-sided, 6 inch long racemes on slender stems that gently arc upward and outward away from the vine."
