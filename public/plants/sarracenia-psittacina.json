    "Produces showy 2 inch red-purple flowers from March to June. They look like upside-down umbrellas and grow on stalks. They bloom in early spring before the first pitcher is formed. The stalks are taller than the pitchers so the pollinators can reach their blooms without getting trapped. Flowers are produced singly on scapes that are 6 to 12 inches in height. The flowers are red in color."

Slippery, downward-pointing hairs.  Pitcher-like leaves collect water and trap insects."
