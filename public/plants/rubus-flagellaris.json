  "wildlife-value": [
    "This plant provides nectar for pollinators. This plant also provides food for large mammals, small mammals, and terrestrial birds as well as cover for small mammals and terrestrial birds. The flowers attract both long-tongued and short-tongued bees, who suck nectar or collect pollen. The flowers also attract butterflies and other insects. The fruit is an important source of summer food to many upland gamebirds and songbirds and mammals, while rabbit and deer browse on the leaves and stems."
