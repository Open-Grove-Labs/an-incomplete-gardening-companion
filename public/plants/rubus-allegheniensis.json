    "The nectar and pollen of the spring flowers attract many kinds of insects, especially long-tongued and short-tongued bees. Butterflies are also attracted to the blooms. The plant provides excellent cover year-round and the fruits are relished by songbirds, small mammals, foxes, raccoons and black bears. During the winter, birds and small mammals eat the seeds left from rotten fruit. White-tailed deer and rabbits browse the leaves, although the plant is moderately resistant to damage from deer"
