    "In the spring, the leaves emerge as small, erect, unopened umbrellas that has silvery white wooly hairs. The leaves are peltate (the petiole is attached to the lower surface of the leaf instead of the margin.)  As the leaves mature, the wooly hairs disappear. Each leaf will begin to open up like an umbrella. The leaves are about 10 inches in diameter and are palmately lobed with 7 to 9 deeply divided linear or lanceolate segments. The margins are serrated. The leaf looks like a shredded umbrella which is its common name."
