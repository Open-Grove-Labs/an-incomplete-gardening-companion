They are backward-arching, dark green to golden green, and taper abruptly near the tip and slightly narrowing at the base. These fronds have large oblong triangular, pinnate-pinnatifid blades, and the 7-8 flattened pinnae are pale green along the margins. Segments have a firm texture. They have a long, thick stipe and are very scaly at the base. The compound leaf has 12-18 pairs of leaflets that are alternate on the stalk. \n\nThe sori are on the underside of the leaflets and lie near the midvein. \n\nFronds turn pale yellow in fall."
