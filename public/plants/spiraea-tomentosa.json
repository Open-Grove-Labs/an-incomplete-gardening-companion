Individual flowers are a little less than ¼\" across, consisting of a short calyx with 5 teeth, 5 spreading petals that are usually pink (less often white), a cluster of 5 pistils, and numerous exerted stamens. The delicate petals are well-rounded and rather wrinkled. The abundant flowers bloom from the top of the panicle downward, gradually turning brown. There is no noticeable floral scent. They bloom July-September."
