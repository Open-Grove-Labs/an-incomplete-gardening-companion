    "The male cones are tiny and yellow and grow axillary on last year's growth. The female cones are tiny and purple and appear on the distal ends of the twig. The male and female cones first appear in the spring. As they mature, the cone is a small light brown elliptical or egg-shaped seed cone and has ovate scales. The cones measure 0.6 to 1 inch long and 0.6 to 1 inch wide and appear terminally on the twigs.  The apex of the cone may be rounded or pointed.  A cone contains 30 to 40 seeds. Each seed measures about 2-3 mm in length. The cones mature in August, and the seeds ripen by late September. By October, the cones will open to release the seeds."

They measure 0.25 to 0.75 inches long with rounded tips. The needles on new growth appear bright green and become dark green as they mature. The surface below is grayish-green or blue and has two white bands. The margins of the needles are finely dentate."

  "uses": "Western hemlock is primarily used for making lumber for building. It is the best source of pulpwood for use in paper production and is also used to make cellophane. American Natives used the timber for firewood or making poles. They also used the bark to make dye or paint, and they used the pitch as a cosmetic. Western hemlock has been used in bonsai."
