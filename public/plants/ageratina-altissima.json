    "Small fluffy bright white flowers (composites with rays absent) atop smooth stems typically rising 3-5’ tall. It blooms from late summer to frost. The upper stems terminate in compound corymbs or flat-headed panicles of flowerheads that span 2 to 6 inches across. Each flowerhead is about ½\" across and contains 10-30 disk florets that have brilliant white corollas and styles. There are no ray florets. Each small disk floret consists of a small tubular corolla with 5 lobes that are spreading and pointed and a divided style that is strongly exerted from the corolla. At the base of each flowerhead, there is a single series of linear floral bracts that are light green and non-overlapping. The blooming period lasts about 2 months for a colony of plants."

    "White snakeroot leaves have long, nettle-like, stalks. The leaf shape ranges from lance like to elliptic-oval. The 3 to 6 inch leaves are paired along the stems and become smaller as they ascend the stems. The lower leaves are cordate to cordate-ovate, while the upper leaves are broadly lanceolate to lanceolate. All of the leaves are largely hairless and strongly serrated-crenate along their margins; they are medium to dark green on their upper surfaces and light green on their lower surfaces. There are 3 prominent veins on the upper surface of each leaf (particularly the lower ones), while the lower surface has an elevated network of veins."
