  "uses": "This plant has been used in Chinese traditional medicine for many years and is still used today. It's traditional uses have been to treat many kinds of blood disorders and also auto-immune disease. Recent investigations have shown the presence of flavonoid derivatives that have an inhibitory action on liver cancer cells in vitro. \n\nThere is also a substance called genistien which has shown anti-cancer, anti-diabetes and anti-oxidant properties. Work is being done to investigate its use as a palliative cure for breast cancer.\n\nGenistien is also toxic to parasites like flukes, roundworms and tapeworms without being harmful to the host."
