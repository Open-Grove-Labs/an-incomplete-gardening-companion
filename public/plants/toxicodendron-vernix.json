    "Small bees and flies are attracted to the flowers for nectar and pollen.  Caterpillars of moths such as Eutelia pulcherrima (Beautiful Eutelia), Marathyssa inficita ( Dark Marathyssa), and Paectes oculatrix (Eyed Paectes) feed on the leaves.  The adult and larvae of the Sumac Flea Beetle also eat the leaves.  Bobwhites, Ring-necked pheasants, and Ruffled Grouse consume the fruits in winter. The Cottontail Rabbit gnaws on the bark and twigs of young shrubs."
