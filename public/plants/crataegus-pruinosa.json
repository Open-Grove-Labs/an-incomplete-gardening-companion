    "Important nectar flower for insects and other pollinators; food plant of many moths including the eggar moth; haws provide winter fruit for songbirds and mammals. It is a larval host plant for Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax), and Viceroy (Limenitis archippus). Red-spotted Purple and Viceroy rarely use this host plant in North Carolina. Good nesting habitat with thorns providing protection from predators."
