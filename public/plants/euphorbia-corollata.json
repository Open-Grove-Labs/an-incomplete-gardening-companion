At maturity, these capsules split open to eject their seeds. The seeds are ovoid-obovoid in shape, and finely mottled. Fruits appear between June and October."

  "flower-description": [
    "Each mature stem terminates in a panicle of flowers up to 9 inches long and 12 inches across. This panicle is somewhat flat-headed and it has an open airy appearance. Individual flower clusters (called cyathia) span about ¼ inch across (including their petaloid bracts). Each cyathium functions like a complete flower and has the tiny unisexual flowers, 5 white petaloid bracts, and 5 green nectar glands at the bases of these bracts. Because Flowering Spurge is monoecious, separate male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers are produced on the same plant. Each male flower has several stamens, while each female flower has an ovary with a tripartite style. The petaloid bracts are obovate in shape; sometimes they are slightly notched at their tips. The branches and pedicels of the inflorescence are light green, glabrous, and terete; pairs of small leafy bracts up to ½ inch long occur at the bases of pedicels and where the branches divide. The blooming period occurs from early summer to early autumn, lasting about 1 to 2 months between June to September for a colony of plants. There is no floral fragrance."

The tips of these leaves are blunt, while their bases are sessile or nearly so. The upper and lower leaf surfaces are light gray-green to medium green and glabrous (rarely the lower leaf surface is pubescent). Leaf venation is pinnate with prominent central veins. The foliage of this plant contains a toxic white latex."
