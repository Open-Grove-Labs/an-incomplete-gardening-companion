    "Slender, sterile, lighter-green, evergreen fronds are arching to flattened.  Erect, dark green, deciduous fertile fronds whither in winter. Fronds taper at both ends. Fronds are blade-shaped, linear or oblanceolate, and wider at the upper half of the blade. The blades are shiny, pointed at the tip, tapered near the base and may have a few hairs. Each blade is cut into leaflets (pinnae) along its length (15-45 pairs), alternately arranged on rachis. Leaflets are oblong, each with an auricle at the base pointing toward the tip of the blade. Undersides may have minute scales. Edges are crenate or serrulate. Blades reach lengths of 20 inches and widths of 0.8-3 inches. Leaflets are 0.4-1 inch long. Leaflets have up to 18 pairs of sori on the underside, each 0.04-0.08 inches in size. Each pair points toward the base of the leaflet in a herringbone fashion. Buds form at the base of the stipe on sterile and/or fertile fronds, and sprout into new ferns when they contact soil."
