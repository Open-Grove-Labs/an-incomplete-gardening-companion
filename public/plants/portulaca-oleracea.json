    "Stems, leaves, and flowers are edible and have a slightly sour and salty taste. It cooks similar to spinach. It is eaten throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Mexico. Is edible and very nutritious because it contains high amounts of omega 3 fatty acids, significant amounts of vitamins A and C and anti-oxidants.  Leaves, stems and flowers can be eaten raw, as in a salad, or boiled. Taste is sour or tart and salty. Mucilaginous quality works to thicken soups or stews.  Seeds are also edible.Contains oxalates that can be toxic in if eaten in high amounts."
