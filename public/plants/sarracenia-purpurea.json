    "Red-purple or greenish-purple 2 1/2 inch flower hangs down on a each stem. Blooms from late spring to early summer. The flower consists of 5 persistent sepals, 5 petals, a single pistil with a large umbrella-shaped style, and numerous stamens (which are largely hidden by the odd style). The sepals and petals are usually reddish purple (rarely yellowish green), while the persistent style is yellowish green. The sepals and petals are broadly ovate. The petals curve inward, covering the style; they soon fall off the flower. In contrast, only the tips of the sepals curve inward toward the center of the flower. Hooked stigmas are located at the \"spokes\" of the umbrella-like style."

The glabrous outer surface of each leaf is green with purple veins to reddish purple. Each leaf has a winged extension along its front where the leaf margins join to form the tubular shape. Green, variegated or suffused with reddish-purple, wide mouth lid. Deep red with prominent veining of the hood.  Downward pointing spines line the throat."
