    "The Golden birch is a larval host plant for moth caterpillars and  Mourning Cloak and Dreamy Duskywing butterflies.  Many moths also use this tree as a host plant. You may see  Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa) which has one flight from June-July, Dreamy Duskywing (Erynnis icelus) with one brood April-July and rarely a second in the south, and Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilo glaucus) which has three flights from February-November in the south and two flights May-September in the north. The seeds are eaten by birds.  Northern flying squirrels and northern saw-whet owls use the hollows that often form in this tree as nest sites.  Squirrels (flying and red) often use the exfoliating bark to line or insulate their nests."

    "Male catkins occur at the tips of last year's twigs in groups of 3-6. During the blooming period, they droop downward and become 2½ to 4 inches long with numerous male florets and their bracts. Male florets occur in groups of 3 behind each bract. Each bract is oval-orbicular in shape and ciliate along its margins. Female catkins occur individually on short spur-twigs near the petioles of leaves; they are upright, ovoid-oblongoid in shape, and greenish, ¾-1¼\" inches long, consisting of numerous female florets in groups of 3 behind a bract.The Yellow birch blooms in mid to late April. It is wind pollinated."
