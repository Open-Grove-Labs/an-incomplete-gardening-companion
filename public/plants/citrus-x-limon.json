  "uses": "Lemon juice, fresh, canned, concentrated and frozen, or dehydrated and powdered, is primarily used for lemonade, in carbonated beverages, or other drinks. It is also used for making pies and tarts, as a flavoring for cakes, cookies, cake icings, puddings, sherbet, hard candy, preserves and pharmaceutical products.  It is also used in salad dressings. Slices of lemon are served as a garnish on fish or meat or with iced or hot tea which allows it to be added to the drink.  Lemon peel oil is used in furniture polishes, detergents, soaps, and shampoos.  The fruit contains bergapten, which is used in tanning lotions as it promotes pigmentation in the skin.  The leaves are used in wreaths and bouquets due to their dark green color and lemony fragrance."
