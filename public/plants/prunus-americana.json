    "Its thickets provide good cover for songbirds and small mammals year-round.  This plant provides nectar for pollinators and is a larval host plant for several species of butterflies.  You may see Coral Hairstreak (Satyrium titus) which has one flight from May-August, Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), which has three flights from February-November in the deep south and March-September in the north, Spring Azure (Celastrina ladon) which has many flights from January-October at the gulf coast getting shorter as you move north, Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) which has two to three broods May-September, and Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax) has two broods from April-October. The fruits are eaten by songbirds, wild turkeys, quail, white-tailed deer, and small mammals. Deer also eat the twigs and leaves."
