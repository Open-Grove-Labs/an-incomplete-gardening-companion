    "Small birds feed on the seeds, and sapsuckers and woodpeckers feed on the insects in the sap or bark. Large birds such as bald eagles roost or nest in the trees. Deer and squirrels use the tree for shelter, and some small birds and small mammals use the tree cavities for nesting.  Deer and elk can be found grazing on the young shoots. The tree also serves as a larval host site for butterflies and moths."

  "uses": "Native Americans used the wood of the tree to make arrows and spears. The roots were used to make baskets and hats. The bark was used medicinally to treat constipation and tuberculosis. They used the young shoots and inner bark as a food source. During World Wars I and II, wood was used to build boats and airplanes. The wood is now used to build guitars and pianos because of its good resonance."
