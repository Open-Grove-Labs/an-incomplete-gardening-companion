    "Members of the genus Acer support Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. The Southern sugar maple flowers are visited by pollinators and seeds are eaten by birds and small mammals. Early spring source of nectar for bees. Nesting site for squires who also consume seeds as food source."
