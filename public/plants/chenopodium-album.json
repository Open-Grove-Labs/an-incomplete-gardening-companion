They are 5\" long , goose foot-shaped (though other shapes are possible too such as triangular, ovate, lanceolate, or even linear), and smooth-margined with some teeth along the edge or undulate lobed.  Leaves are green, sometimes with tints of pink or purple along the margins, and a white mealy coating produced by tiny hairs on the leaves. The hairs are denser on the underside of the leaves, making it appear lighter in color.  As the leaves mature, the white hairs become more sparse.  The petioles are about half the length of the leaves."
