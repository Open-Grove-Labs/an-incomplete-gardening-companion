The flower measures about 1.5 inches long. The mimosa bloom is monoecious (has both male and female parts) and looks like a pink fluffy powder puff.  Each flower cluster grows at the base of the current year's twigs."

    "The leaves are medium green in color and appear on a long slender stem that measures 10 to 20 inches long. Each stem is lined with pinnae which appears opposite of each other. There may be 4 to 6 pairs of pinnae, but as the tree grows this can increase to 20 to 30 pairs.  The individual pinnae vary from 2-4 inches long.  Each pinna is lined with 10-20 leaflets and each leaflet is 3/8 inches long.  The leaves are fern-like and give the tree the appearance of being light and feathery. When it rains and during the night the leaves close downward. In the fall the leaves do not change color, and they typically fall to the ground after the first frost."
