    "This plant supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae. Early Goldenrod flowers attract butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. Songbirds eat the seeds. Solidago support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) asteris, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) braccata, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) hirticincta, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) nubecula, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) simplex, Perdita (Perdita) octomaculata, Melissodes (Eumelissodes) fumosus, Colletes simulans, and Colletes solidaginis. Songbirds are attracted to the seeds."
