The female florets are reddish-brown and have clusters of 2-5 cone-like catkins.  Initially, they are only 1/4 inch long, but as they mature they measure 3/4 to 1 inch long and 1/2 inch wide.  The blooming period occurs in early spring before the leaves emerge.  The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind.  After blooming the male catkins wither and fall away, but the female catkins remain on the tree through summer.  In the fall, the female catkins release their seeds."

In the fall, the leaves will either remain green or turn brown.  During the winter, the leaves may either drop off or wither on the tree.  Parasites may occur such as Dasineura tortilis or Aceria nalepai."
