    "This is a larval host plant for several butterflies.  Clouded Sulphur (Colias philodice) larvae appear from May to October in the north and from March to November in the south. There are 3 flights in the north and 4 to 5 flights in the south (but it rarely uses this plant as a host in North Carolina).  Zarucco Duskywing (Erynnis zarucco) has three broods in the deep south from March-October, appearing as early as January in Florida. Silver-Spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus) appears from May-September with three-four broods in the deep south, two broods in the east, and one brood in the north and west. The buds and catkins are eaten by birds.  It provides an excellent leaf cover for birds in wetland sites.   Bees are attracted to its flowers and rabbits depend on the sprouts and seeds during the winter."
