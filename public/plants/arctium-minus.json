  "flower-description": [
    "Pink to purple flowerheads are approximately 3/4-1 inch in size and arranged on stalks.  Flowerheads are comprised of many disk florets and needle-thin bracts that terminate in a sharp, hooked tip.  There are no ray florets on the flowerhead.  After flowers whither, the globular bracts turn brown and enclose the flowers, forming a spiked bur covered with looped ends.  This design is highly effective in clinging to animals, birds or clothing and aids in dispersal of seed.  Burs may be very difficult to remove."
