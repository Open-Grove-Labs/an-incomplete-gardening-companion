  "wildlife-value": [
    "Pollinated by insects, flies, wasps, and bees. Spicebush Swallowtail Butterfly larvae feed on the leaves. Leafcutter bees cut sections of the leaf margins ultimately removing most of the leaf.  Berries are eaten by birds such as cardinals and thrashers.  The swamp rabbit eats the stems and leaves."

    "The fruits are bright red, spicy, oval to round, and measure 0.25 to 0.5 inches long.  They appear only on the female plants. The fruit typically matures in late summer to fall and often remain on the plant until the leaves have fallen.  Each fruit produces one seed.  The seeds are dispersed by wildlife either birds or mammals.  They can germinate the following spring."

There are separate male and female shrubs. Flowers lack petals and have bright yellow tepals. Staminate flowers have 2 whorls of tepals and 9-12 stamens. Pistillate flowers have one whorl of tepals and an inner whorl of scales that produce nectar. The Pondberry flowers tend to appear in the second or fourth year of the growth of the shrub."

They appear oval and then taper to a sharp pointed tip.  They measure 2 to 6 inches long and 1.2 to 2.4 inches wide.  They are widest at the middle or just below the middle of the leaf.  There are netted veins on both sides of the leaf, but the soft slightly hair surface is only on the undersides."
