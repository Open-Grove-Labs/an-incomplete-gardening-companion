  "uses": "The Littleleaf Linden has known to have existed as early as 760 AD. In Germanic and Norse countries, it was the favorite tree of Freya, the goodness of love, and Frigga, the goddess of married love and hearth.  Maidens would dance and hug the tree in hopes of fertility. In Scandinavia, the tree was to be avoided at night because it was supposedly haunted by elves and fairies."
