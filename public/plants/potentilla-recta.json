    "Members of the genus Potentilla support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Derandrena) ziziaeformis, and Panurginus potentillae, as well as numerous other varieties of bees, wasps, moths, and sawflies.  Some grasshoppers also feed on this plant.  It is not eaten in abundance by many herbivores due to the bitter-tasting organic substance present in the plant.  That allows the plant to spread in such areas as cattle pastures.  White-tailed deer and rabbits occasionally consume the foliage."
