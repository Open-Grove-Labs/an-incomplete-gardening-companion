    "The Mockernut hickory is a host plant for Banded Hairstreak (Satyrium calanus) caterpillars which have one flight from June-August everywhere but Florida where they emerge April-May and many moths including the Luna moth.  This is a larval host plant for butterflies and moths.  It also supports Hickory Horndevil (Citheronia regalis) which have one brood and appear from May to mid-September. Adult Hickory Horndevil moths do not feed. The nuts are eaten by squirrels, chipmunks and black bears. Fruit is consumed by wood ducks, red-bellied woodpeckers, red fox, squirrels, beaver, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, turkey, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and white-footed mice. Provide cavities for woodpeckers, black ratsnake, raccoons, and carolina chickadees"
