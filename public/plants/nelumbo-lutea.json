    "After blooming, nut-like fruits begin to form imbedded in the flat surface of the receptacle. Receptacles turn brown, harden and acquire a woody-like texture as they dry (suggestive of wasps’ nests). Eventually, the receptacle breaks off and falls into the water where it floats as it slowly disintegrates, distributing its seed as it goes. Fruits are available June-October."
