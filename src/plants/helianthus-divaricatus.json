    "This is a larval host plant that supports Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis).  The Silvery Checkerspot has at least 1-2 broods in the north from June-July in the deep south and Texas, they have as many as 3-4 broods from May through September. The flowers are attractive to butterflies and other pollinators.  Its seeds are favored by songbirds, ruffed grouse, quail, mourning doves, and small mammals.  Leave standing dead flowers into the winter as natural bird feeders.  Members of the genus Helianthus support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) accepta, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) aliciae, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) helianthi, Melissodes (Eumelissodes) agilis, Dieunomia (Dieunomia) heteropoda, Megachile (Sayapis) pugnata, and Paranthidium (Paranthidium) jugatorium."
