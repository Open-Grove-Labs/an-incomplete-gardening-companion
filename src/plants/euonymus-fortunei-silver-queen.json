On shoots with immature leaves, the leaves are often conspicuously whitened along the central and lateral veins; flowers and fruits are not produced on such shoots. On shoots with mature leaves, the leaves are less whitened or green along the central and lateral veins; these shoots usually produce flowers and fruits."
