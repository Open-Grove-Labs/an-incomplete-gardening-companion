    "Blooms from mid-summer to fall. Flower is white with a tip that has a green stripe on the upper surface.  The smooth flowers are tightly spiraled. Individual flowers are ¼ inch or less in length, often nodding, the narrow lateral sepals spread wide like open arms with the lance-like lateral petals and upper sepal closely aligned, their tapered tips flared up, making a three parted hood above the frilly, broadly spreading lower lip. The center of the lower lip is tinged green or yellow. An erect, sharply tapered oval green bract encloses the ovary at each flower's base. A spiral typically has 4 to 6 flowers in a cycle"
