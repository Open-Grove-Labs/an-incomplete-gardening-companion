    "After the petals drop and if the ovary has been pollinated, it will begin to swell. The seed pod develops at the top of the flower. It takes 5 months for the seed pod to mature. It turns brown and then splits open to scatter the seeds. The dry capsule contains pear-shaped seeds anywhere from 20 to 300 seeds. The seeds are scattered and germinate after a period of cold weather."
