    "Tiny yellow flowers bloom along upper stems in small axillary and terminal clusters from August to October. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. Each flowerhead is about ¾–1\" across, consisting of 10-20 ray florets that surround a similar number of disk florets. The petaloid rays of these flowerheads are lavender or pale blue-violet (rarely white), and they are individually linear-oblong in shape. The corollas of the disk florets are short-tubular with 5 minute lobes at their apices. Initially, these corollas are yellow, but they become reddish purple with age. On unusual specimens, these corollas are light pink to nearly white. At the base of each flowerhead, the overlapping green phyllaries (scaly floral bracts) are linear-lanceolate and glabrous to finely pubescent."

  "leaf-description": [
    "Leaves become gradually smaller as they ascend the stems. The petioles are very slender and about 1\" long on the lower leaves, while the upper leaves are nearly sessile. The lower to middle leaves are lanceolate-ovate with indented bases, while the upper leaves are lanceolate with rounded bases. All leaves taper gradually into slender acute tips, while their margins are smooth and often slightly ciliate. Longest leaves are found near the middle of each stem. Basal and lower stem leaves usually wither prior to flowering."
