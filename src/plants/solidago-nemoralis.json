    "This plant supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae. Common Goldenrod flowers attract butterflies, native bees, honey bees and other pollinators. Songbirds eat the seeds. Members of the genus Solidago support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) asteris, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) braccata, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) hirticincta, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) nubecula, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) simplex, Perdita (Perdita) octomaculata, Melissodes (Eumelissodes) fumosus, Colletes simulans, and Colletes solidaginis.  Songbirds eat the seeds."
