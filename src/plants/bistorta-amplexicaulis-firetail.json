    "The rhizome is blackish-brown or purplish on the outside and reddish-brown on the inside. It contains about 20% tannin, and also contains gallic acids, gum, and is high in starch. In Pakistan, leaves are used as a vegetable. In Northern England, the leaves of the plant are used in combination with oatmeal, eggs, and herbs to make a bitter pudding during Lent.  The roots contain large amounts of starch and are roasted and are eaten similar to potatoes in Russia and northern Asia. Bread can be made from flour made from the roots."

  "uses": "The entire plant of Mountain Fleece has been used to make medicinal products. It has been used to treat diarrhea, cough, nose bleeds, wound healing, ulcers, gout, backache, hemorrhoids, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.  The root of Mountain Fleece is one of the strongest vegetable astringents among native vegetables. The plant is also used to make tea, for the treatment of flu, fever, and joint problems. The root has been used for tanning leather."
