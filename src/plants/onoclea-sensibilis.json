    "The sensitive fern has broad, almost triangular fronds. The sterile fronds are deeply pinnatified to bipinnatified, and thin texture. The fronds of most pinnae are nearly opposite, the rachis is smooth, pale tan or yellow. The fronds turn yellow or russet in the fall. Fertile fronds emerge in late summer, are woody with beadlike segments, brown and persist into winter. Stipes are long (one half to two-thirds of frond), network veined. It is dimorphic (occurring in or representing two distinct forms)."
