    "It provides winter cover. This plant supports Palamedes Swallowtail (Papilio palamedes) larvae which has two flights from March-December with a partial third flight in the south. The adult butterflies feed on nectar from flowers like sweet pepperbush, thistles, blue flag, and azalea. This plant also supports Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus) larvae which have 2 generations per year from April-October.  Adult Spicebush Swallowtail butterflies feed on nectar from Japanese honeysuckle, jewelweed, thistles, milkweed, azalea, dogbane, lantana, mimosa, and sweet pepperbush. This plant has almost been wiped out by the Redbay Ambrosia Beetle. The foilage is browsed by white-tailed deer and fruits are eaten by songbirds, wild turkeys, quails, foxes, squirrels, raccoons, opossums and black bear."
