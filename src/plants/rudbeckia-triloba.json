    "Attracts bees, butterflies, and other pollinators with nectar and pollen in the blooms. This is a larval host plant for Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis) caterpillars which have one brood in the north and two broods from May-September in the rest of its range. This plant also supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae. The adults feed on nectar from red clover, common milkweed, and dogbane. Songbirds, especially American Goldfinches, eat the seeds in the fall."
