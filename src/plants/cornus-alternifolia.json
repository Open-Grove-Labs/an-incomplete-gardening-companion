    "Fruits are attractive to birds and plants provide nesting sites. Chipmunks, White-Tailed Deer, and Cottontail Rabbits also enjoy the fruits. Beavers will eat the branches of the shrub when near water.  Many species of Lepidopteran caterpillars feed on Cornus.  Members of the genus Cornus support the following specialized bees:  Andrena (Gonandrena) fragilis, Andrena (Gonandrena) integra, and Andrena (Gonandrena) platyparia."
