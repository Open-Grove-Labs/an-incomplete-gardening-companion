    "This plant has opposite, compound leaves which have a yellow to orange fall color. The leaf is made up of five leaflets. These are elliptic in shape with a broad base and a relatively pointy tip. They are finely serrated. When they emerge in the spring, they have soft hairs, but as they mature, most of the leaflet loses the hairs. The top becomes totally smooth, but the hairs remain on the bottom along the midvein and some of the larger secondary veins. The mature leaves are a dull dark green on top and a pale yellow-green below."
