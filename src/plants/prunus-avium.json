If a couple of pits (stones, which enclose the seeds) are accidentally swallowed, it will not cause poisoning, but care should be taken to remove pits before fruits are processed in a blender or any other machine that will crack open the pits. Symptoms include gasping, weakness, excitement, pupil dilation, spasms, convulsions, coma and respiratory failure."
