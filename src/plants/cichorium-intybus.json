    "The alternate leaves are up to 8\" long and 2\" across, becoming smaller as they ascend the stems. They are lance-shaped and resemble dandelion leaves at the base. Each leaf narrows gradually where it is either sessile or clasps the stem. Leaf margins vary from lobed to dentate to and as the leaves move up the stem they lose their petioles and clasp the stem. \n There are usually conspicuous hairs along the central vein of the lower leaf surface."
