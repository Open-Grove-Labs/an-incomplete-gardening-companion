  "uses": "The oil from cumin is used in fragrances, cosmetics, and essential oils.  In some cultures, the cumin seed has been used medicinally as a carminative, sedative, stimulant, and an antispasmodic, as well as the plant water being used for medicinal purposes.  The oil has also been used as an antibacterial agent. There is no modern scientific evidence that it is effective as a therapeutic. In ancient Egypt cumin seed was used as a preservative in mummification."
