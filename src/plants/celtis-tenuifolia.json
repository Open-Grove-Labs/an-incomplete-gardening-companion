    "This is a larval host plant for several butterflies including American Snout (Libytheana carinenta), Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa), Hackberry Emperor (Asterocampa celtis), and Tawny Emperor (Asterocampa clyton) and Question Mark Butterfly (Polygonia interrogationis). Questionmark butterflies have an interesting life cycles: overwintered adult Question Mark butterflies lay eggs from spring until the end of May. These will appear as summer adults from May-September, laying eggs that then develop into the winter adult form. The winter adults appear in late August and shelter for the winter starting the cycle all over again. Adult Question Mark butterflies feed on rotting fruit, tree sap, dung, and carrion only visiting flowers for feeding when absolutely necessary. Also a host plant for the American Snout, Mourning Cloak and Tawny Emperer.  Three species of butterflies feed on the leaves as larvae: Hackberry Emperor, Tawny Emperor, and American Snout.  Many birds and small mammals eat the fruits."

They are similar to common hackberry (C. occidentalis) but has slightly narrower leaves that are more regularly toothed at the base. Dwarf Hackberry are cordate (heart-shaped) at the base, while common hackberry usually are not. The winter buds are brown and hairy, similar to those of other hackberries, but smaller, only 1 to 2 centimeters long. Terminal buds absent."
