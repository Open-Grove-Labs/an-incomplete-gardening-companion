    "The leaves and roots are edible, and this plant is a delicacy in Korea (where the plant is called 'do-ra-jee'). While the roots are edible in a variety of ways (raw, dried, or cooked), they are very small which may be hard to cook with. The leaves can be eaten raw in salads and can taste anywhere from mild to sweet to even bitter depending on the season (bitter flavor happens generally mid-summer)."
