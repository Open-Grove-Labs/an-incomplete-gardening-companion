    "The grass-like upper culms terminate in narrow panicles of spikelets about 2 to 8 inches long that are grayish-green, purplish green, or silvery green.  Each panicle has a central stalk (rachis), short erect branches (up to 2\" long), and a spike-like appearance and rather shiny during the period of bloom. The spikelets are narrowly lanceoloid in shape; each spikelet has 1 or 2 tiny glumes, a single awned lemma, and a membranous palea enclosing a perfect floret. The bodies of the lemmas are as long as the spikelets; they are narrowly lanceolate, convex along their outer surfaces, longitudinally 3-veined, and finely hairy toward their bases. The blooming period occurs from mid-summer to early autumn. The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind."

    "The gray-green or blue-green leaves are up to 3½ inches long and 1/5 of an inch across. They are smooth and ascending to widely spreading. The leaf blades are either flat or furrowed longitudinally with parallel venation. Leaves are rolled in the bud. The leafy culms of this grass are initially erect, but they have a tendency to sprawl later in the year when their inflorescences develop. The culms are light green to pale purple (less often bright red), terete, and glabrous; they are often decumbent at their bases and abundantly branched above.  The leaf blades are either flat or they are furrowed longitudinally (often with a central furrow and 2 smaller lateral furrows). The leaf sheaths are light green to medium green, longitudinally veined, and hairless; they are rather short and expose the culms at intervals. The lower nodes are swollen, glabrous, and pale green to pale red; the upper nodes are more dark and sunken in appearance. The ligules are inconspicuously hairy."
