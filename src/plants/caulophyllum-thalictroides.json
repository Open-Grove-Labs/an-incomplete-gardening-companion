Underneath each flower, there are 3 to 4 green bractlets that resemble sepals. The blooming period occurs in spring before the leaves have fully developed."

The subleaflets are 1 to 3 inches long and ¾ to 2 inches across, broadly ovate-oblong to obovate-oblong, and smooth along their margins. The surface of the subleaflets is glabrous and green. The upper compound leaf of a flowering plant is located under the inflorescence. This compound leaf resembles the lower compound leaf, except its 3 compound leaflets are smaller in size."
