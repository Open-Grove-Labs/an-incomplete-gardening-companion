    "Purple globular flowerheads are arranged on stalks in flat-headed cymes approximately 1-1.5 inches in size.  Flowerheads are comprised of many disk florets and needle-thin bracts that terminate in a sharp tip with a hook at the end.  There are no ray florets on the flowerhead.  After flowers whither, bracts turn brown and enclose the flowers, forming a spiked bur covered with looped ends.  This design is highly effective in clinging to animal fur, bird feathers or clothing and aids in dispersal of seed.  Burs may be very difficult to remove."

  "uses": "This plant has been in widespread use for centuries in many parts of the world.  Historically, Japan used its roots for food for nearly 1000 years, as well as using roots, leaves, and seeds for medicinal purposes. Europeans also used the plant for both food and medicine.  Pilgrims introduced the plant to North America for similar uses.  Roots are still widely eaten as a vegetable in Japan, Korea and Taiwan and to a lesser extent in Italy, Portugal and Brazil."
