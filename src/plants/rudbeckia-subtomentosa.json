    "This is a larval host plant for Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis) caterpillars which have one brood in the north and two broods from May-September in the rest of its range. The adults feed on nectar from red clover, common milkweed, and dogbane. Bees and other polinators are attracted by the pollen and nectar of the flowers. Caterpillars of various butterfly species also feed on the plant. This plant also supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae."
