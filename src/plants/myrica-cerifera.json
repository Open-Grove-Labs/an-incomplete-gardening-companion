    "Waxmyrtle provides excellent winter and extreme weather cover.  It is a host plant for the Red-Banded Hairstreak butterfly.  Flowers provide an excellent source of nectar for honeybees and butterflies.  The fruits are eaten by birds, especially yellow-rumped warbler (which are very efficient at digesting the waxy fruits) in the fall and winter."

Fruits are present from August through October. Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) can digest the wax on the fruits and are important seed dispersers of wax myrtle."

Male flowers have multiple stamens, while female flowers are a one-celled ovary. Flowers bloom in April. Male and female flowers are usually on separate plants, but sometimes a plant produces both male and female flowers or bisexual flowers."
