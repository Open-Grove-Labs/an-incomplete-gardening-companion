    "Wasabi rhizomes are finely grated into a green paste about the consistency of toothpaste, which produces a distinct spicy condiment similar to horseradish and hot mustard.  It is served with sushi, salads, poultry, sausage, steamed rice, soups, and a garnish for bread.  The leaves, flowers, leafstalks, and sliced rhizomes are used to make a Japanese pickle called wasabi-zuke.  Young leaves are used in salads and sandwiches. Note, eating raw leaves can cause diarrhea."
