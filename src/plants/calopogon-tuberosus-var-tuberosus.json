    "Two to fifteen flowers, 1 to 1 1/2 inches long, in a spike at the end of a central stem. The rachis of this floral spike is green to reddish purple, terete, and glabrous. Each flower consists of 3 petaloid sepals, 3 petals, an exposed reproductive column, and an inferior ovary. Both the sepals and petals (excluding the petal that has been modified into a lip) are pink to deep rosy pink and may have faint veins of dark rosy pink. The sepals are ovate or broadly oblong-ovate in shape, while the petals are broadly elliptic or elliptic-ovate in shape. Depending on the stage of development, both petals and sepals are spreading and more or less incurved from their tips; their upper surfaces are flat to somewhat concave. The third petal has been modified into an upper lip about ¾ of an inch long. This upper lip is linear in shape (grooved above and convex below), except toward its tip, where it has been widened by 2 lateral lobes. At the center of this lobed tip, is a patch of white and a cluster of clubbed pseudo-stamens; these pseudo-stamens are hair-like in appearance and yellow to orange. Elsewhere, the lip is pink to rosy pink like the sepals and remaining petals. The lip is also hinged at its base. Flowers bloom from April to July."

The leaf tapers gradually into a narrow base enclosed by a sheath, while its tip is narrowly acute and hull-shaped. The upper surface of the leaf is often slightly concave. Both the upper and lower leaf surfaces are yellowish green to medium green and glabrous. Leaf venation is parallel. Below the well-developed leaf, there are 1-2 rudimentary leaves that are sheath-like and inconspicuous."
