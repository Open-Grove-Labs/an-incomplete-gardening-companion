    "Leaves are silvery-green, alternate, broadly ovate, and finely divided into blunt, narrow, pinnatifid segments.  The length can reach between 1-3 inches with a width of roughly .5-1.5 inches and may differ in shape and size– basal leaves tend to be larger and more deeply lobed while upper leaves are smaller and more simple. The surfaces are covered with silvery hairs on both sides. Its soft, gray foliage makes it a good plant for toning down brighter colored flowers. The leaves of most species are strongly scented, almost sage-like; however, the scent can be unpleasant when crushed."
