    "Its flowers are attractive to bees, butterflies and other pollinators.  This plant supports Silvery Checkerspot (Chlosyne nycteis) larvae which has two broods from May-September. The adults feed on nectar from red clover, common milkweed, and dogbane. This plant also supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae. Songbirds, especially American goldfinches, eat the seeds. Slightly deer resistant."
