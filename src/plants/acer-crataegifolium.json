The bark is attractive all year but provides excellent winter interest.  Shoots are greenish red and buds are purple red.  The upright vase shape is very attractive and requires very little pruning to keep branches up and out of garden beds. Protect the bark from winter frost and full sun as it is prone to cracking."
