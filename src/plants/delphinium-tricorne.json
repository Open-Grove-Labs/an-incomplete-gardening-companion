The toxicity of the plant may vary depending on seasonal changes and field conditions; as the plant matures, it generally becomes less toxic. Clinical effects include constipation, colic, increased salivation, stiffness, weakness, recumbency, and convulsions. Cardiac failure may occur, as can death from respiratory paralysis."
