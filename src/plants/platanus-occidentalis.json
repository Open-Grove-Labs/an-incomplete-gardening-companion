    "The fruit ball is a showy, fuzzy, long-stalked, round ball that is 0.5 to 1-inches in diameter. There are 1 to 2 fruit balls per peduncle, usually one. The stalk is 3 to 6 inches long. They ripen to brown in the fall and persist into early winter. Each ball is fibrous interiorly and contains many seed-like fruits called achenes. As fall progresses the balls break down and the seeds fly out in downy tufts on the wind. Typically the fruits fall to the ground and then split open to release their seeds."

The male flower is greenish-yellow, and the female flower is red."

The leaves turn yellow to brown in the fall.\nLeaves are floccose to tomentose when young, and become pubescent on veins at maturity. Stipules on young leaves persist into fall, are large, and are acuminate toothed."
