  "uses": "The mountain hemlock is used primarily as an ornamental. Its wood is inferior to the western hemlock and is not typically used for lumber or pulpwood. This tree grows in high altitudes which also makes it difficult to access. Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest tribes used the leaves to make a poultice to treat burns. They used the bark to treat colds, flu, and nausea. The bark was also used for coloring their skin and tanning hides."
