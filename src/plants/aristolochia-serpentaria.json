    "Flowers are cross-pollinated primarily by flesh flies, fungus gnats, and possibly carrion beetles searching out nectar. The caterpillars of a butterfly, the Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor), feed on the foliage of Virginia snakeroot, although more than one plant is required to complete their development. Because the foliage and roots are toxic and unpleasant-tasting, mammalian herbivores do not feed on this plant.  Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor) larvae which appear in late spring and summer in the east and California. In the south and southwest regions it most commonly appears in late summer through fall. Adult Pipevine Swallowtail butterflies also feed solely off of flower nectar from other plants like azaleas, thistles, verbena, lupines, and lilacs."
