    "Provides nesting sites and protection for birds, small mammals and other pollinators. It is a larval host plant for Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax), and Viceroy (Limenitis archippus). Red-spotted Purple and Viceroy rarely use this host plant in North Carolina. Flowers attract pollinators. It is a larval host plant. The fruits are eaten by birds and mammals."
