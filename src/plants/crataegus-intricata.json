    "Native bees nectar at the flowers. Important nectar flower for insects; food plant of many moths including the eggar moth; haws provide winter fruit for songbirds.

Red-spotted Purple and Viceroy rarely use this host plant in North Carolina. Good nesting habitat with thorns providing protection from predators."
