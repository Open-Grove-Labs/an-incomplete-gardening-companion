They are edible to humans but have very little flavor."

  "uses": "Native Americans use the roots, leaves, and branches to treat malaria and rheumatism. The roots are also used to treat dizziness and dysentery. In the past, U.S. farmers crushed the leaves and placed them under the harnesses of their horses and mules to repel mosquitoes.  The Agricultural  Research Service has found that two compounds in the leaves, callicarpenal, and intermedeol, act as a mosquito repellant."
