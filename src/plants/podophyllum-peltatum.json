    "The leaves are folded as the stem elongates in the spring. When the stem nearly reaches 12 to 18 inches tall, the leaves will unfold and become umbrella-like. The leaves are smooth, pale green, orbicular, fully peltate, and deeply divided into 6 to 9 palmate lobes. The margins are coarsely dentate and often cleft at the tip. There are only 1 to 2 leaves per stem. Each leaf measures nearly 12 inches long and equally as wide and is attached to the stalk near the middle of the leaf. The plant flowers if it has more than one leaf. Nonflowering plants have a single umbrella-like leaf at the top of the stem.  The leaves decline and go dormant before fall. The petiole is 3 to 6 inches long, light green, and smooth."
