    "There must be a male and female plant to produce seeds. Pollination occurs by insects or the wind. The male plant produces a pineapple-shaped cone that may grow up to 2 feet tall. The female plant produces a large golden rounded cone.  If pollination is successful, the female will produce a packed seedhead. Pollination occurs from April to June. The seeds mature from September to October."

    "Non-flowering. The plant is dioecious (requiring male and female plants to produce seeds). The male plant produces elliptical-shaped yellowish pollen cones, and the female produces round cones that produce seeds when pollinated.  This plant rarely produces cones when grown as a houseplant indoors."

The fronds grow in a circular pattern that creates a rosette pattern. Each leaf has a midrib and divides into many 3 to 6-inch leaflets that are narrow, leathery, and have spiny tipped ends. The leaflets have entire revolute or curled back edges and lower leaflets are often spinelike."
