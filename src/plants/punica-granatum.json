    "Juice from seeeds high in potassium and vitamin C and other antioxidants.  Select a fruit that is heavy for the size and does not have cracks or splits. Pomegranates are hand-harvested at peak ripeness. Store whole fruit at room temperature for a few days or place in the refrigerator in plastic bags for up to 3 months.  Arils can also be refrigerated or frozen in a single layer than placed in bags in the freezer for a quick snack later.  Grenadine is a red syrup used to flavor beverages that is made from pomegranate seeds."

An aril is a fleshy, juicy, brightly colored tissue, which covers the actual seed.\n2 to 3.5 in. edible fruit in fall; thick rind, seedy and tart"
