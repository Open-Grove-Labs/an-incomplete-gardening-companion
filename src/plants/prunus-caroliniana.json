    "Provides winter and extreme weather cover. Host plant for Coral Hairstreak, Red-spotted Purple, Spring/Summer Azures, and Viceroy butterflies. This is also a larval host plant to Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus). You may see three flights from February-November in the deep south and two flights from May-September in the north. Adult butterflies source nectar from the spring flowers and bees source the pollen.  Fruits are eaten by songbirds, wild turkeys, quail, raccoons, foxes, and small mammals.  White-tailed deer browse foliage."
