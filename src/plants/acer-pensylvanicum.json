  "uses": "The Striped Maple has limited uses. Its porous and fine-grained wood has occasionally been used by cabinet makers for inlay material. Whistles can be carved easily from branch sections. Native Americans reportedly used the wood to make arrows and the bark to make a beverage. Farmers in the American colonies and Canada reportedly fed their cattle both dried and green leaves in the winter; in the spring, when the buds had begun to swell, they turned their horses and cows into the woods to browse on the young shoots. Native Americans used the Striped Maple to treat a variety of ailments including bronchial and kidney troubles, colds, and coughs."
