    "Bees are attracted to the early nectar source of the flowers. Members of the genus Acer support Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. Flower nectar attracts bees and other pollinators.  Seeds are enjoyed by birds.  The fruit, along with the buds, are a primary food source for gray squirrels in late winter and early spring. Sprouts are a favorite food for white-tailed deer, but this tree is moderately resistant to damage."
