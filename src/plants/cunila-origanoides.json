There are soft hairs along the outside of the lobes. The filaments of the stamen are white to light purple. The anthers are pink to lavender, but as the flower ages, they turn brown.  The style is white to light purple.  The flowers bloom from late summer to mid-autumn and generally last 1.5 months ( August to September)."
