    "EDIBLE PARTS: Apples, but discard the seeds. HARVEST TIME: Only collect fruit from areas you know have NOT been treated with pesticides. SAFE HANDLING PROCEDURES: Wash fruit thoroughly with warm water to remove dirt and debris. Do not use dish detergent or any type of sanitizer. These products can leave a residue. Wild apples are generally quite a bit smaller than cultivated varieties. They also tend to be somewhat harder and definitely more tart. Crab-apples can be used in place of domestic apples in many cooked recipes."
