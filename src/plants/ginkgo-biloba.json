    "As a gymnosperm, Ginkgo does not produce fruit but its seeds (only on female trees) are plumlike, yellow-orange, the outer, fleshy pulp foul-smelling when ripe, the inner wall hard, smooth, and cream colored.   When the seeds fall to the ground they can be quite messy.   Most of the ornamental ginkgoes in the United States are male."

    "Ginkgos are gymnosperms and do not produce \"flowers\" however they are dioecious with separate male and female trees. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls. Female plants produce ovules at the end of a stalk. Fertilization occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses, and algae."
