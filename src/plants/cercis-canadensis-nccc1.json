  "uses": "Native American tribes made the bark into a medicinal tea and took cold infusions of the roots & inner bark to treat fever and congestion. In the winter, it was valuable firewood. Because it is one of the first plants to flower, the flowering branches were brought into homes to “drive the winter out”.  People in the Appalachian Mountains used young stems to season venison. Children were fond of eating the flowers, which taste pea-like."
