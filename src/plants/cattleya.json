    "The inflorescence usually contains 2 to 5 flowers in a terminal raceme, though some species have tens of flowers per inflorescence.  Only one stalk grows per pseudobulb.  The inflorescence is enclosed in a sheath to support the weight of the flowers.\nThe flowers are large and brightly colorful, most being between 4 to 10 inches with some species as small as 2 inches.  The segments of the flower are usually wide. The lips will often contrast in color with the rest of the flower."
