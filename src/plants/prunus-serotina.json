You may see Coral Hairstreak (Satyrium titus) which has one flight from May-August, Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), which has three flights from February-November in the deep south and March-September in the north, Spring Azure (Celastrina ladon) which has many flights from January-October at the gulf coast getting shorter as you move north, Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) which has two to three broods May-September, and Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax) has two broods from April-October. Fruits are eaten by songbirds, wild turkeys, quail, white-tailed deer and small mammals."

If a couple of pits are accidentally swallowed, it will not cause poisoning. The pits are more poisonous if they are broken to expose the seeds. Fruit that has not been pitted should not processed in a blender or other machine that might crack open the pits to reveal the poisonous seeds. Fruits contain cyanogenic compounds, which when acted upon by digestive enzymes, can cause poisoning."
