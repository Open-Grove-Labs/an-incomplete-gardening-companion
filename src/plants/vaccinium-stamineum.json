    "This plant provides nectar for pollinators and supports Brown Elfin (Callophrys augustinus) larvae which have one flight and appear from May to July in the North and March to April in the South. Adult Brown Elfin butterflies feed on flower nectar. Adult butterflies nectar from the blooms.  Its fruits are eaten by songbirds, small mammals, ruffed grouse, wild turkeys, deer and black bears.  Members of the genus Vaccinium support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Conandrena) bradleyi, Andrena (Andrena) carolina, Panurginus atramontensis, Habropoda laboriosa, Colletes productus, Colletes validus, and Osmia (Melanosmia) virga."
