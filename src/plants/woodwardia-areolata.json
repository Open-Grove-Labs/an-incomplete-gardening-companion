    "Features pinnatifid, glossy green sterile fronds which emerge pinkish in spring and unroll to 1'-2' long. Sterile fronds typically have 8-10 pairs of lance-shaped pinnae (leaflets) with small marginal teeth. Fertile fronds arise in summer to the same length as the sterile ones but have narrower leaf divisions. The pinnae of both fronds have netted veins and the sori (spores) on the fertile fronds are arranged in chain-like rows parallel to the pinnae midribs, hence the common name."
