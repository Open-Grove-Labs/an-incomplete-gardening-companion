    "In general, the flowers (used as edible flowers) and leaves (used in salads, teas, and sandwiches) are edible.\n\nMore specifically, the wrinkled, dull gray-green leaves that are covered with bristly hairs are edible. They can be eaten raw or cooked in the same manner as spinach, but have the taste and scent of a salty cucumber. Used as an herb or added to a salad. It is best to chop the leaves up finely as the hairy leaves do not leave a pleasant feeling in the mouth. Once dried, the leaves lose their flavor.\n\nThe stems are also flavorful and can be used once dried for flavoring beverages."
