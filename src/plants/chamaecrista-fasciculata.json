    "Flowers are a nectar source for bees and butterflies and seeds are consumed by songbirds, quail and wild turkeys. It is a host plant for the Cloudless Sulphur (Phoebis sennae), Little Yellow (Pyrisitia lisa), and Sleepy Orange (Eurema nicippe) larvae.  Cloudless Sulphur can have just one summer flight in the south or many flights in the Deep south. If they travel to the northern United States in late summer/ early fall, they will most likely not lay eggs. Little Yellow has 1-5 flights in late spring lasting through early fall (closer to 5 flights if they live in the Deep South or South Texas). Sleepy Orange have 4-5 flights which will be in the summer if they live in the north or year-round if they live in the Deep South or southern Texas. The plant also provides cover for game birds."
