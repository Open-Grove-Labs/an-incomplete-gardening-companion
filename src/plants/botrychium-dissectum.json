    "The Cutleaf Grape Fern has leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant has a single sterile leaf and a single fertile leaf. The two are joined near the ground surface. The sterile leaf is often parallel to the ground. It measures 6 inches long and 6 inches wide. It is pinnately divided into 6 pairs of leaflets with a terminal leaflet. Each leaflet is divided into 3-6 pairs of sub-leaflets with a terminal sub-leaflet. The sub-leaflets are lanceolate to ovate in shape. Each sub-leaflet is divided into 3-8 ovate lobes. The sterile leaf is medium to dark green in color, and the underside is medium green. The fertile leaf is up to 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. It is on a long stalk that stands above the sterile leaf. The fertile leaf looks like a panicle with clusters of spore cases or sporangia. The sporangia are on the terminal ends of the fertile leaf. The sporangia are smooth and pale yellow. In late fall to early winter, the sporangia mature. They will split open to release the spores to the wind. The fertile leaf will wither away. The sterile leaf color changes to bronze over the winter and withers away in the spring or summer. The margins of the leaves may vary and depend on the variety."
