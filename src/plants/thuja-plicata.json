    "Seed cones and pollen cones appear on the same plant (monoecious).  Slender, clustered, elliptical seed cones are 0.4-0.7 inches long, and 0.2 inches wide, usually containing 8-12 overlapping sharp-pointed scales.  Initially, seed cones are green in the spring then ripen to brown in the fall.  At maturity, the cones open to release 3-6 seeds each (1x5 mm in size) with lateral papery wings.  Pollen cones appear at tips of leaf shoots, are 3-4 mm long, initially emerging as reddish-brown and shed yellow pollen in the spring."

It makes an ideal low-smoke fuel for drying fish over and open fire.  The roots and strips of bark were also harvested for making rope, baskets, mats, and clothing."
