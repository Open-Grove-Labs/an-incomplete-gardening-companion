    "Insignificant half inch flowers, but colorful bracts that bloom mid-spring. The flowers are carried in the axils of the leaves, (that is, the point where the leaf emerges from the stem). The plant produces female and male flowers held on a raceme less than half an inch long. The female flower, at the base, has tiny, bright green bracts with serrated edges and translucent 'hairs' at the base of the pistil. It is only after pollination has occurred that the flowers become more obvious. The male flowers are held at the end of the raceme in a tight cluster of many flowers around a quarter of an inch long. They have white to golden yellow petals."
