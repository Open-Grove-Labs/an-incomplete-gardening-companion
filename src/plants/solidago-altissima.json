    "This plant supports Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata) larvae. Bees, butterflies, and beetles, especially flower (soldier) beetles (Chauliognathus) are strongly attracted to the nectar-rich flowers.  Members of the genus Solidago support the following specialized bees: Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) asteris, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) braccata, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) hirticincta, Andrena (Cnemidandrena) nubecula, Andrena (Callandrena s.l.) simplex, Perdita (Perdita) octomaculata, Melissodes (Eumelissodes) fumosus, Colletes simulans, and Colletes solidaginis."
