    "This tree is mildly resistant to damage by deer. The wildlife value is high. The acorns are eaten by woodpeckers, blue jays, small mammals, wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, and black bears. Oak trees support a wide variety of Lepidopteran.  You may see Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. Banded Hairstreak (Satyrium calanus), which have one flight from June-August everywhere but Florida where they emerge April-May. Edward's Hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii), has one flight from May-July in the south and June-July in the north.  Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), has three to four flights in the south from February-November and two flights in the north from May-September.  White-M Hairstreak (Parrhasius m-album) has three broods in the north from February-October.  Horace’s Duskywing (Erynnis horatius) has three broods in Texas and the deep south from January-November, and two broods in the north from April-September.  Juvenal’s Duskywing (Erynnis juvenalis) has one brood from April-June, appearing as early as January in Florida. It attracts a wide range of insects which in turn feed the birds."

The lobes can cut down to the midrib. The leaf color is medium to dark green and slightly glossy on the upper side. They are tomentose, white to silver on the undersides which adds an interesting effect in the wind. They are two tone and explains the name bicolor. The petiole is yellow to greenish-yellow and 0.5 to 0.75 inches long.  Because it hybridizes easily in the wild, there is variation in leaf shape and winter color.  Winter color can be brown to yellows or reds."

The wood is used in furniture but is not as valuable as white oak due to having more knots."
