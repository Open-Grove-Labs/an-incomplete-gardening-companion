    "This is a larval host plant. The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) has three flights from February-November in the deep south and March-September in the north. The Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis Astyanax) has two broods from April-October. Seedlings and young trees are browsed by rabbits, deer, and domestic stock. Beavers use the saplings and poles for food and dam construction. Birds are also attracted to this tree."
