Opposite, simple, ovate-elliptic, 1 to 3 inches long and 3/4 to 1 1/2 inches across, crenate-serrate, thinly coriaceous.  Often discolors in winter. Leaves occur at intervals along the young shoots; densely distributed and rather leathery in texture. The leaf tips are acute to blunt, while the leaf bases are rounded, truncate, or cuneate (wedge-shaped). The upper side of leaves is medium to dark green, hairless, and usually shiny, while the lower side of leaves is more pale, hairless, and dull. On shoots with immature leaves, the latter are often conspicuously whitened along the central and lateral veins; flowers and fruits are not produced on such shoots. On shoots with mature leaves, the latter are less whitened or green along the central and lateral veins; these shoots usually produce flowers and fruits."
