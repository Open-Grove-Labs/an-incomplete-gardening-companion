    "The central stem terminates in a inflorescence that has whorls of flowers at intervals along its length. This inflorescence can vary from 2 to 8 inches in length. The tubular corolla of each flower is about 1/3 inch long and divided into 2 lips. The hairy upper lip functions as a protective hood, while the lower lip is divided into 3 lobes (a central lobe and two smaller side lobes), which functions as a landing pad for visiting insects. The flowers are light pink or white, often with rosy pink splotches within the throat. The green calyx is hairless and at least half as long as the tube of the corolla (not including the lips). It is divided into 5 triangular segments that curl outward as the ovaries mature. The blooming period occurs during the summer and lasts about 1-2 months."
