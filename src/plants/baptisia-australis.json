    "On spikes and arranged on 16-inches-tall racemes, flowers are generally purple/blue (about .75-in.).\nPlant it in full sun to part shade but in the shade tends to get leggy and droop over.  It forms tall clumps which are especially attractive planted next to wooden fences. The bright, indigo blue flowers are attractive when combined with yellow or white flowering perennials. \nFlowers are either on long-stalked clusters above the leaves or axillary. They bloom in late spring (sometimes around early summer) in white, blue, purple/blue, or yellow and are irregular and pea-shaped."
