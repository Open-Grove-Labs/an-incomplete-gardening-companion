    "The flowers of this genus are quite small but the inflorescences can be as long as 18 inches. The most common inflorescence is a flaccid spike that appears in the axis of the leaves or at the end of a branch. These hang down in a very attractive way, especially when the flowers are in the shades of red through pink. There are some species with non-showy, short greenish yellow inflorescences.\n\nThe plants are usually monoecious (both male and female parts on the same plant), but some are dioecious (female parts on one plant; male parts on another)"

    "The leaves of this genus come in all sizes, from just over 1inch to 8 inches long. The same is true of the shape. The leaves can be heart shaped, elliptical to lanceolate, oblong and even rhomboidal. But no matter the size or shape they are all simple and carried alternately with a rough, nettle-like surface. Some have stipules; some have crenated or serrated edges; some have palmate venation and others pennate (arranged on each side of the midvein similarly to the barbs of a feather).\n\nThe one we use in the garden frequently have leaves that are mottled in combinations of green, purple, yellow, orange, pink or white, but usually the leaves are green - light, mid or dark. Most species have leaves that turn reddish brown in the autumn, hence the common name 'Copperleaf'."
