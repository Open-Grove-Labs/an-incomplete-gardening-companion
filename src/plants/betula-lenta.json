  "uses": "This plant is used in the production of wintergreen oil. In the past, the people of the Appalachians cut large numbers of this tree to produce wintergreen oil. 100 saplings and young trees were needed to produce only a quart of the oil. The hard, close grained lumber is used for furniture and interior trims."
