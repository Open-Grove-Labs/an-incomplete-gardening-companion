    "The leaves of this plant aren't leaves at all. The pads are modified stems. These dark, dull green stem segments are not easily detached. Their shape is oval to circular and they are usually thick and fleshy. If there has been a drought then the pads become wrinkled as the plant takes advantage of their stored moisture. They are covered with 1-4, inch long spines which grow from an areole. The flattened needle shaped spines are white to a reddish brown color and can stand straight up or spread out from the areole. The spines are turned downward.\n\nThe pads of this plant are also covered with dense tufts of pale yellow, tan to red-brown, ¼ inch long barbed bristles."

The pads were roasted for a vegetable and the sap was used for medical applications. The spines were used to pierce the ear and also for lancing small skin abcesses. The roasted pads were also used by midwives to lubricate their hands when removing the placenta."
