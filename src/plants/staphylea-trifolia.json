    "Flowers give way to inflated, bladder-like, egg-shaped, papery seed capsules (1 to 2 inches long) which mature in late summer and often persist into early winter. Seed capsules add interest to dried flower arrangements. This capsule is obovoid or ovoid in shape with 3-angular lobes. Immature capsules are green during the summer, but they become light brown during the fall. At this time, the seeds can be made to rattle inside their capsule; there is a single seed per cell. In North Carolina, the fruits are available from August to October."

Each flower is about 1/3 inch long, 1/4 inch across; it has 5 outer sepals, 5 inner petals, several stamens, and a pistil. Initially, both the sepals and petals are white; shortly later the sepals become light green or dull pink. The slender pedicels are a little longer than the flowers."
