Numerous blossoms are held in ball-shaped clusters at the ends of the sticky-hairy, branched stems.  Each flower is an elongated trumpet shape – a long narrow tube topped by five small lobes.  The base of the tube are pink and the sepals may also have a pink tint.  Beneath the flower head, at the top of the stem are five thin yellowish-green bracts. The flowers only open in the cool evening and give off a fragrance of vanilla."

  "uses": "Native Americans used the Sand-verbena flowers and roots for stomach and bowel problems and, when cooked and ground into a powder, mixed with corn. It was named a ‘life’ medicine that could be used to give one a good appetite and make one fat. A cold infusion was used as a lotion for mouth sores and to bathe hot tired feet."
