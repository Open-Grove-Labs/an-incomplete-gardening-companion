    "This plant supports Imperial Moth (Eacles imperialis) larvae which have one brood per season and appear from April-October in the south. Adult Imperial Moths do not feed. Seeds are eaten by birds and small mammals. The foliage is eaten by deer and grouse. Small rodents eat the bark. The needles are used as nesting materials, and the tree is excellent for roosting and nesting."

    "The fruit is a terminal cone that may be solitary or in groups of 2 to 5 cones. They are large and measure 5 to 12 inches long, are cylinder-like, and short-stalked. They mature in the second season and ripen during August and September. During the warm weather, they may drip globs of white resin. The color of the cones ranges from yellow or light brown to reddish-brown to dark brown. the seeds are reddish-brown, and 0.2 to 0.28 inches long with a 0.8 to 1-inch long wing.  Cone production usually starts at age 7 and increases in production as the tree ages."

    "This evergreen is monoecious. The male cones or staminate strobili are small, yellow, and cluster at the tips of the branches. The female cones or ovulate strobili appear on stalks at the tips of the upper branches and are larger, rounded, and yellowish-green to bright pink. They appear in mid-June. Pollen is dispersed in late June and early July.  The pollen cones or conelets are about 0.6 to 1.6 inches long at pollination and grow to 1 to 2 inches long by the end of the first growing season."

  "uses": "This tree is an important timber tree. It is used to make frames, sashes, doors, interior paneling, construct buildings, and also used for making matchsticks and toothpicks. Native Americans used the bark medicinally for stomach pains, wounds from cuts or sores,  and to treat tuberculosis. They also chewed the pitch like chewing gum."
